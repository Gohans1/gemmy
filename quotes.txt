"Yet when you are called stupid, it makes you angry. Because something within you entertains the possibility that you might, in fact, be. Then something else within you grows irritated by the idea that you might be. This internal conflict manifests itself as anger."

- Kapil Gupta
"Wrong does not exist. Hope leads only to disappointment."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you seek to be comfortable in the presence of difficult people, understand the source of the discomfort."

- Kapil Gupta
"The discomfort that arises from being in the presence of a difficult person arises from your insistence that they not be difficult."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have no interest in answering questions based upon curiosity."

- Kapil Gupta
"I do not recall what I say to anyone."

- Kapil Gupta
"It matters not if god exists or not."

- Kapil Gupta
"If there is a god, you will depend upon him. If there isn’t, you will attempt to create a surrogate. Neither will benefit you."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is no right or wrong."

- Kapil Gupta
"When one wish is granted, you will beg for another. When it is not, you will either wait in hope, or curse out of spite. Dependency will rob you of your freedom."

- Kapil Gupta
"What I am saying is to rely upon yourself for all the needs that arise within you."

- Kapil Gupta
"You were hungry. Therefore, you ate. Do you find meaning in this?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Do you believe that it flows in order to reach the ocean?"

- Kapil Gupta
"I do not believe that anyone should or should not become anything."

- Kapil Gupta
"We are all here for but a short time. Then we die. If something is guaranteed to end in death, how can there be any meaning in it?"

- Kapil Gupta
"If a human life is devoted to something, one tends to lose oneself in it. As one loses oneself in it, the more blissful one becomes."

- Kapil Gupta
"Anything that has a guaranteed shelf life has no meaning."

- Kapil Gupta
"Care for the child in every way. But if you believe that he belongs to you, you will interfere. And this interference will cost you in ways that you cannot imagine."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have no interest in convincing you, or coaxing you into anything. I simply provide direct Truth. I do not wish to convince you of it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Human beings live in an ocean of misunderstanding."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is misunderstanding that put me on the path toward Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"You ask a question that you do not truly seek an answer to."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is that attachment is the greatest bondage in the life of man. The problem that you are experiencing is not that you do not know how to be unattached. The problem is that you do not realize the consequences of attachment."

- Kapil Gupta
"Behavior is the leaf of a tree. Understanding is its root."

- Kapil Gupta
"If the consequences are acceptable to you, you may choose to proceed. If they are not, you may choose to examine your motivations."

- Kapil Gupta
"Living in attachment, there can be no lasting peace."

- Kapil Gupta
"No human being knows love. He knows only attachment in the name of love."

- Kapil Gupta
"Responsibility is a societal creation. No one is truly responsible for another. You do not owe your children anything. They do not owe you anything."

- Kapil Gupta
"That which comes from the idea of responsibility is forced, artificial, and often produces resentment and the expectation for reciprocation."

- Kapil Gupta
"A part of you relishes getting angry. For when you do, you are able to exercise your right to become angry. You enjoy this right. For you feel that you have been wronged, and thus your anger is justified"

- Kapil Gupta
"The remorse makes you feel better and morally correct. For if you had felt good about getting angry, you would have a difficult time accepting yourself."

- Kapil Gupta
"That anger is not as reactionary as you think it to be. It is a weapon that you enjoy using in order to protect your ego and to bolster it."

- Kapil Gupta
"I try to find the rock bottom Truth in the situation. And devote myself to extracting all need."

- Kapil Gupta
"An even greater disaster is your imprisonment to the hope of keeping this person from disaster."

- Kapil Gupta
"The more you run toward him, the more he will run from you. If you feign retreat, he will continue to run."

- Kapil Gupta
"That it is likely you who steered him toward the disaster that you are now
attempting to save him from."

- Kapil Gupta
"Do not look at this from the standpoint of blame. For this will lead to further problems. The most fruitful realizations are quiet ones."

- Kapil Gupta
"Understand that you are the architect of this relationship. And, in many ways, the architect of your son’s fate. Become the person he would seek to embrace. Provide a place of peace that he is looking for in the wrong places. As he recognizes that you have transformed from a place of need, into a source of quiet comfort, he will come. And he will listen."

- Kapil Gupta
"The mind peddles in desire. It has an unending appetite for desire. It is a wanting machine. It cannot get enough of that which it enjoys. This is the seed of addiction."

- Kapil Gupta
"All addiction creates bondage."

- Kapil Gupta
"From morning until night, a human seeks nothing other than pleasure. In the smallest thing. And the largest thing."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is the search for pleasure that produces pain"

- Kapil Gupta
"When a man no longer feels the need to chase, life begins to chase him."

- Kapil Gupta
"If they did not contain pleasure somewhere within, a human would not pursue them."

- Kapil Gupta
"The guilt is protective. It serves as a buffer between you and your feelings of
superiority."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is constant. Reactivity fades."

- Kapil Gupta
"In order to overcome the guilt, you will have to resolve within yourself the need that this guilt serves within you."

- Kapil Gupta
"It isn’t about the behavior. It is about the source of the behavior."

- Kapil Gupta
"A man is responsible only to himself."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a man chooses to give, he may give. But whether he chooses to give or not, he surely does not “owe.""

- Kapil Gupta
"In order to have peace in a relationship, there must be freedom."

- Kapil Gupta
"Compromise muddies the water. It is a cheap and fruitless bartering between the reactive wants of each individual. It perpetuates itself. And moves inevitably toward conflict."

- Kapil Gupta
"Two individuals who need each other will only have conflict. They can never have a relationship."

- Kapil Gupta
"This is too big a word for human beings to understand. Like is more useful and powerful than love."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is a failure of understanding. But understanding often does not happen until middle age or later. Marriage typically happens much earlier."

- Kapil Gupta
"A relationship of peace is a relationship that is more parallel than perpendicular. It is two individuals that move side by side. Rather than two individuals that intersect. A maintenance of individuality and freedom results in the prevalence of peace."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is no should."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is no right or wrong."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is no good or bad."

- Kapil Gupta
" I have no interest in doctrine. I do not follow rules. I have no need for groups."

- Kapil Gupta
"I don’t believe in anything."

- Kapil Gupta
"Any human being can find the Truth. Whether he be a person of religion or not. One may argue that St Francis of Assisi was a man of religion. He found the Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one devotes himself to a god so completely that he himself disappears, he is certain to find the Truth. The completeness of devotion matters. The object of devotion matters not"

- Kapil Gupta
"God has become a wishing well. Religion is a social club."

- Kapil Gupta
"Spirituality is a concoction of prescriptions and half-truths"

- Kapil Gupta
"The one who seeks the Truth is as rare as a sun that rises in the west."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a desire for the Truth is in someone’s bones, then he will not stop until he finds it. Not because he should. But because he has no choice."

- Kapil Gupta
"If there is someone who naturally and continually lives in the present because of having practiced mindfulness, that will benefit him greatly."

- Kapil Gupta
"I’m neither for or against. I am interested only in the Truth. I am interested only in what is effective."

- Kapil Gupta
"If they are looking for a way to naturally live in the present moment, mindfulness is not effective."

- Kapil Gupta
"You can attempt to force your attention upon the present moment, but the mind will fight you every step of the way."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Buddha was not mindful. He was mindless."

- Kapil Gupta
"I am not a meditation instructor."

- Kapil Gupta
"I do not do things purely for health."

- Kapil Gupta
"Mindfulness is forced awareness. To be lost in what you are doing is to lose the self. Instead of trying to improve the self."

- Kapil Gupta
"Whether it be meditativeness or meditation, it must be an effect rather than a goal. That which one pursues as a goal never arrives. Any prescription that one pursues, he becomes imprisoned to."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why pursue scraps, when the ultimate heights are available to you?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Man is not lazy."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man is lazy and undisciplined for the things that do not move him. He is motivated and voracious for the things that inspire him."

- Kapil Gupta
"Discipline is an attempt to force oneself to do that which he fundamentally does not wish to do."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one’s desire for achievement is pure, he will be sufficiently motivated to do all that needs to be done in order to achieve."

- Kapil Gupta
"Forcing oneself is short-lived. As all things that are insincere are short-lived. If one is honest and sincere about his motivations, he will move with himself, instead of against himself."

- Kapil Gupta
"happiness is a myth."

- Kapil Gupta
"The idea of happiness is born as a reaction to misery. If a human being did not have misery, he would not seek happiness."

- Kapil Gupta
"Happiness is the attempt to escape from misery."

- Kapil Gupta
"Understanding that happiness is a fleeting emotion. One cannot build a home in it. In understanding this, one naturally begins to seek an alternative."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is something within you that is causing an emptiness. It seeks to be satisfied. Until it is satisfied, it will create within you a feeling of aimlessness."

- Kapil Gupta
"The single most important characteristic of a Journey toward the Ultimate is that upon reaching it, one becomes satisfied for the rest of his life"

- Kapil Gupta
"Instead of trying to “live” a life, one must become life itself."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a man tries to “live” a life, he suffers at every turn. If he devotes his life, the game changes."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one dabbles, he suffers endlessly and fails. If he devotes the whole of his life to something, he is due for an ultimate boon, and is engaged during the Journey."

- Kapil Gupta
"Devote means to surrender. Devote means to allocate in its entirety. One man might devote his life to conquering anger."

- Kapil Gupta
"Devote the whole of oneself to god or to any other endeavor takes one away from oneself. And this is the door to freedom. The door to becoming life itself."

- Kapil Gupta
"You are confusing ‘want’ with ‘preference.’ You are confusing it with ‘it would be nice if . . .’"

- Kapil Gupta
"When I say ‘want’, I am not speaking of preference or passing desire. I am speaking of a life-and-death sort of want."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you do not know the Truth, you must take the long and arduous road. But the Truth always takes a fraction of the time and provides a far greater result."

- Kapil Gupta
"Siddha Training prepares one for a life that is beyond competition. So much so that every match is won before it begins."

- Kapil Gupta
"Performance is a side effect"

- Kapil Gupta
"Performance does not live in the limbs. It does not live in the brain. It cannot be exercised, strategized, or ritualized. One must understand the conditions that allow performance to emerge."

- Kapil Gupta
"It does not rain because it wishes to rain. When the conditions are ripe, rain has no choice but to fall."

- Kapil Gupta
"If your question is invested with a sincere desire to know, you will welcome it. If it is not, you will succumb to the outrage that your mind is likely to create."

- Kapil Gupta
"The fear of having to leave behind the comfort of his identity. The fear of loss."

- Kapil Gupta
"The luxury of self-pity. The sympathies of victimhood. Such things are not easily sacrificed."

- Kapil Gupta
"The mind has created everything. But its ultimate creation is You."

- Kapil Gupta
'The person that you call “yourself” is a manufactured entity. It is the lens through which you experience the entirety of your life. It is the field upon which all events take place. This is the mind’s magnum opus.'

- Kapil Gupta
"The mind was meant to be a slave. But in creating you, it has become your Master."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one seeks to become the master of the mind, one must begin by exploring intensely the details of the mind’s creation. That is, this “you” that it has created. Explore it as an innocent observer. Explore it as the one who is not the “you.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Anger is born of unfulfilled desire. It is born of unfulfilled expectation."

- Kapil Gupta
"Fear is the natural consequence of man not knowing himself."

- Kapil Gupta
"The fundamental basis of all fear is fear of oneself."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man seeks pleasure for himself. He seeks stability for himself. He seeks egoic satisfaction. He seeks many things in order to make himself feel a certain way. Any situation that threatens how he feels about himself will bring fear."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a man achieved a rock bottom steady state with himself. If he had a relationship with, or an understanding of, himself that was unshakeable. He would become immune to fear."

- Kapil Gupta
"The reason that you do not harm people is because of your nature. Not because it is wrong."

- Kapil Gupta
"The reason that they harm people is because their ignorance blinds them
to the consequences of their actions."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man does not seek world peace. He seeks self-peace."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is that if every man in the world found peace in himself, the “world”
would forever be at peace."

- Kapil Gupta
"Time is thought."

- Kapil Gupta
"Time comes into existence when man begins to think."

- Kapil Gupta
"When he has discovered the cocoon of the present moment, thinking ceases. When he arrives at a state of No-Mind, time comes to an end."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is when he lives under the spell of the mind that he is insane."

- Kapil Gupta
"The state of No-Mind is a state of No-Self. When on arrives at this state, his talents become free from all interference. They become uninhibited. He begins to commune with the gods."

- Kapil Gupta
"Meditation may provide a sense of peace and well-being. But it rarely produces a state of No-Mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"Where there is a self, there is an attachment to the self. Where there is an attachment to the self, there is an attachment to all people and things related to the self. Where there is an attachment to people and things, there is endless suffering."

- Kapil Gupta
"The absolute truth is that if a man does not acquire this freedom, he will have wasted the whole of his life."

- Kapil Gupta
"You live inside your mind. The mind is the world. It is a place of endless torment. It is a place which requires you to put out fires that never end."

- Kapil Gupta
"One may have the mind or he may have the moment. He cannot have both."

- Kapil Gupta
"Happiness cannot satisfy any human being."

- Kapil Gupta
"The presence of misery gave birth to the idea of happiness. No human being seeks happiness. What he seeks is an escape from misery."

- Kapil Gupta
"The world consists of nothing but anxiety and misery. The same way that a swimming pool contains only water. It has nothing else to offer you. "

- Kapil Gupta
"Man has created this world. But he was not meant to live within it."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is an honest, genuine, and sincere journey in which the Truth is constantly seen at every step. And the more one understands the Truth, the more deeply he begins to experience it. And the more deeply he begins to experience it, it becomes home. And the turmoil that was once his life begins to completely fall away. Once he has reached this stage, he becomes the Creator of his life. By a simple wave of his hand, he controls all things. And becomes a god."

- Kapil Gupta
"The thing that you feel is the mind’s greatest illusion. It does not exist."

- Kapil Gupta
"Investigation. Desperation. And understanding."

- Kapil Gupta
"One cannot love or improve something that does not exist."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is no self to be improved. But you are welcome to carry on believing that there is."

- Kapil Gupta
"Where there is a fertile field, weeds will grow. One may choose to pull out the weeds if he so wishes. But he will be doing so for all his life. For each time he removes one, another will sprout in its place."

- Kapil Gupta
"The field that you will be annihilating did not exist to begin with. What you are annihilating is a false idea."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because where there is no self, there is no interference. Where there is no self, there is no confusion. Where there is no self, there is no complications, upheavals, conflicts, or turmoils. There is nothing. And where there is nothing, one is available to everything."

- Kapil Gupta
"You will have to become wary of the ideas that you have always been told are
innately human."

- Kapil Gupta
"The path to becoming pure is a path to becoming perfect. And a path to becoming perfect must be without compromise. Not because I say it. But because you desire it."

- Kapil Gupta
"You will have to become wary of the ideas that you have always been told are
innately human."

- Kapil Gupta
"All stains that society has tarnished you with, and called “normal.” In cleansing oneself of all such impurities, a peace and a freedom begins to dawn in a man’s life. The likes of which he has never known."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is a matter of being inspired by a possibility. Habits will change by
themselves."

- Kapil Gupta
"A human that is impure, showers his loved ones in impurity. A human that becomes pure, showers them in purity. One need not transform four people. Transform one, and the remaining three will feel the ripples that flow from him."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one truly wishes to pursue something, then he will only be content in pursuing it to its ultimate possibility"

- Kapil Gupta
"The greatest change arises from inspiration."

- Kapil Gupta
"Buddha did not try to change the world. He turned himself into a Buddha. And because he did, the world began to change."

- Kapil Gupta
"The modulation of the people and the events in our lives is done by way of
gravitational pull, than by direct manipulation."

- Kapil Gupta
"To invest in them the Truths that will keep them safe and successful in their journey of life, while surrendering the need to take ownership of these ideas so that they may take ownership of them, is wisdom and dispassion"

- Kapil Gupta
"I have no faith in belief. Nor do I subscribe to any belief. Either I Know, or I Do Not Know. But I do not “believe.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"To Know something intellectually is to never have known it at all."

- Kapil Gupta
"Every man who becomes wise was once a fool. In the beginning, I too understood things on a purely intellectual level."

- Kapil Gupta
"It happens through a constant revisitation of the ideal that you wish to Know. A constant revisitation allows it to seep into one’s bones. A constant revisitation allows one to Understand it from all angles. And that which was once Intellectual, in time becomes Experiential. And the space within oneself that was once occupied by The Mind, slowly becomes replaced by the Knowing. And the human being begins to Become the ideal that he so eagerly has revisited."

- Kapil Gupta
"An ideal that makes you shake. An ideal that literally brings tears to your eyes. For this will demonstrate your Authenticity for wanting to know it on more than simply an intellectual level."

- Kapil Gupta
"Most men have no interest in such depth. They trade and roam in the cosmetics of how’s and wherefore’s. They have no authentic longing for anything. They are interested only in window shopping. They seek to live their lives on safe and comfortable shores, never daring to drink the ocean"

- Kapil Gupta
"Nothing in the world is practical unless it is first Non-negotiable."

- Kapil Gupta
"Only The Artist who tastes the nectar of life. The scientist tastes only the bitter chemicals found in test tubes."

- Kapil Gupta
"The human being who is not swimming in Sincerity cannot ever be given a Way that is sufficiently practical for him."

- Kapil Gupta
"You must first discover what you seek Freedom For and Freedom From. What is your personal definition of Freedom? What is it that you would like to happen to you? What does it look like? What does it feel like? You must answer many such questions. And you must examine your answers in order to see if they are of the Mind or of the Heart. How Insane are you for the things that you seek? How insane are you for this Freedom?"

- Kapil Gupta
"If he insists upon nothing in particular, he will live in the default and wayward musings of The Mind. Unless you are going Somewhere, you are going Nowhere. And even Nowhere is the Perfect place to go if you are specifically going Nowhere."

- Kapil Gupta
"Be Uncompromising. For the man who refuses to compromise holds The Universe in his hands."

- Kapil Gupta
"Hurt arises, my student. It does not visit."

- Kapil Gupta
"Each has a reason for his actions. He acts according to the will that arises within him. I do not know what I have done. And I do not need to know. But there is something that I most definitely have done to cause you to react this way against me."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because for the briefest moment when I first heard the news, I thought that you should not have done what you did. This thought flashed across my mind for not more than a second. But it arose nonetheless. And this suggests that my mind has not yet totally been eradicated."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because after all that has happened my student, I am still learning how to best become your Master."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man spends so much of his time trying to “succeed” that he overlooks the things that will give it to him quite easily."

- Kapil Gupta
"The entire notion of “success” versus “failure” has become a thing of its own. Man has created a beast. And this beast called “success” has become completely independent of the thing that he wishes to succeed at."

- Kapil Gupta
"If he is drawn to the romanticism of striving for success and hard work, then he is the sort of man who is more interested in the “struggle.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"If one seeks to have a peaceful journey, then he will have to understand some of the Truths."

- Kapil Gupta
"Musashi devoted the whole of his days and nights to a study of not only the sword, but of the mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"He had no need to chase success. There was no success. There was no failure. He became the Supreme Master of the Sword."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one has given the whole of himself to becoming a Master, he will do what is necessary to become it. And it will be a joy for him. It will be an intense journey. And peaceful the entire way."

- Kapil Gupta
"Hard work and practice are for those who try to become that which they secretly believe that it is difficult for them to become."

- Kapil Gupta
"If I tell you that such and such is the way things are, you may hear me, but in many ways the words will pass you by"

- Kapil Gupta
"You will understand their dictionary meaning. But you will not understand their depth."

- Kapil Gupta
"That anxiety is a byproduct. It cannot be eliminated head-on. One must penetrate the source from which it arises."

- Kapil Gupta
"The source is the failure to realize that which must be realized. In the heart. Never in the head."

- Kapil Gupta
"There are things that a man was meant to experience that most would relegate to the realm of magic and fantasy. But, in fact, magic and fantasy are at the heart of man’s existence."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man lives in a world whose noise is so wide and deep that it requires either an extraordinary DNA or a cataclysmic chance occurrence for him to turn away from the noise and seek The Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is almost impossible for him to deem that all that he has been told for his entire life and all that he hears on a daily basis is completely false and full of lies. Monumentally rare are such men. But this is the only way. For without it, one is destined to a life of misery, turmoil, and anxiety."

- Kapil Gupta
"From the standpoint of his birthright, he is not. From the standpoint of what is possible for him, he is not. But from the standpoint of the likelihood and practicality of his turning against all the noise of the world and seek a way out of his mind, yes he is almost certainly doomed."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth and The Path does not come to a man by accident."

- Kapil Gupta
"One must have an overwhelming and genuine desire to live a life of Freedom and completely free of turmoil. Or he simply will not have it. And if he dares to think in such a way, society will tell him that such things are, as you say, “magic and fantasy.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"If your desire is genuine, learning will come. All things come by way of Sincerity."

- Kapil Gupta
"It was my sincere desire to know The Truth about all things. The absolute, undeniable, ultimate Truth. I knew that The Truth would lead to such a life."

- Kapil Gupta
"Never do I give birth to its possibility, my student. And if one does not give birth to something, how can it possibly arise?"

- Kapil Gupta
"I have children. But I am no longer a parent"

- Kapil Gupta
"When a human being gets a child, something very interesting happens. He becomes cast into a role of a parent. And this is not a role that he is ready for."

- Kapil Gupta
"A parent sees the child as His Child. He does not see the child as a human being. And thus it is doomed from the beginning."

- Kapil Gupta
"The child is an entity independent of the parent. He belongs to Nature. He does not belong to the Parent. Every parent is a surrogate. Nature uses the parent to bear the child. But it does not grant her ownership of him."

- Kapil Gupta
"That which a man Owns, he destroys."

- Kapil Gupta
"In order for me to see them, I first had to eliminate the role of “parent.” It is only once I stepped out of this role, that seeing them became possible."

- Kapil Gupta
"A child does not deserve a “parent.” He deserves freedom from one."

- Kapil Gupta
"Where I once parented my children, I now revere them. Where I once taught them, I now learn from them. And is it not the height of irony, that they now listen to my every word, when I no longer need them to listen."

- Kapil Gupta
"My life is like the snowflake. It falls with the freedom of falling. Knowing that when it lands it will feel no pain. Because the moment it touches the ground, it will melt."

- Kapil Gupta
"My life is like the leaf that trembles and changes color according to the seasons. Not knowing or caring that it has done so."

- Kapil Gupta
"My life is like the Eagle that soars across the great blue sky. With no place, in particular, to go."

- Kapil Gupta
" My life does not move. It has too much weight to move. It never leaves the moment. For it cannot survive outside of it."

- Kapil Gupta
"I will say that I do not know what possesses a man to have such sensibilities. I do not know why one man seeks such a life, and another does not. I can only say that to live such a life was bound to happen for me."

- Kapil Gupta
"I lived in ignorance for many years. However, there existed within me a deep and profound desire to Know. And an insistence to Truly Live. And I knew that because of the Sincerity of my desire, the universe would send someone to me in order to guide me to the life I have described."

- Kapil Gupta
"My life no longer has pain. This is correct. There is no turmoil in the least. In fact, my life happens as I wish it to happen."

- Kapil Gupta
"But then there are the few to whom life suspends its will and bows to the man himself."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Way is not a map, my student."

- Kapil Gupta
"The way is revealed without being revealed."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Way is only possible as an alchemy. And it takes birth the moment that a student gives the whole of his heart to the One Who Knows."

- Kapil Gupta
"When you are truly ready to live such a life, you will give all of it to me. When nothing on the whole of this Earth matters more to you, you will surrender it with open hands and soft eyes."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is no longer a series of things. There is no longer a number of events. For me, there is only THIS."

- Kapil Gupta
"THIS. THIS is my entire world. THIS is my solid foundation. THIS is my entire life. If you were to cut my life open longitudinally, you would find only THIS."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man spends the whole of his life searching for things that do not exist. This is the fate of almost every man on this Earth."

- Kapil Gupta
"My words have shaken the very ground beneath your
feet, moments after this exchange you will return to a life of enslavement. You will have all but forgotten about this exchange."

- Kapil Gupta
"Honesty has a home in you. You need not apologize."

- Kapil Gupta
"The man who seeks many things has not found the root which affects them all."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is no “many,” my dear student. There is only One."

- Kapil Gupta
"It matters not how I know, student. What matters is that you do not know what precisely you seek. Is this not so?"

- Kapil Gupta
"They believe that this is the way it was supposed to be. They believe that this is all there is. They believe that nothing beyond this misery, strife, and turmoil exists. They say things like, “that’s life.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Men who seek The Truth are as rare as the rarest gem. They come to me and tell me that, at last, they have found me. But what they do not realize is that I, at last, have found them."

- Kapil Gupta
"Talent is a real thing. And although I had it, I could not wield it."

- Kapil Gupta
"I was ignorant in the manner of battle. And I was not learned in the majesty of the mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"Many times I went into battle with more skill than my opponent. But I had no chance."

- Kapil Gupta
"My student, possessing something is one thing. Having access to it is another."

- Kapil Gupta
"I worked long and hard to develop my skill. But it remained locked away. For I was prey to the greed of winning. And this greed of winning led me into the bowels of fear. And a fearful man cannot fight. He can only flail."

- Kapil Gupta
"A willingness to learn is rare among men. Men are predisposed to “do.” Few among them are willing and ready to Learn."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because I was willing to finally learn, I finally began to listen to my Master. For years he had tried to teach me, but the rarest thing in all the world is a Genuine Student."

- Kapil Gupta
"My skill was locked away because of ego. And an
egoistic man cannot learn."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because the egoistic man views battle as a contest. And thus he becomes limited."

- Kapil Gupta
"Is that “incremental betterment” and “inching past the other” instantly relegates a man into struggle. He may have attained the heavens. But because his eyes are fixed upon the other, he barely attains the low hanging limb of the willow."

- Kapil Gupta
"One must understand what it is he wishes to achieve. He must understand precisely why it is that he fights. And his vision must be greater than the greatest who have come before him. In order to take himself and his craft to a level it would not have reached without him."

- Kapil Gupta
"Yes, Freedom. And when I became free, my skill was unleashed. I could wield it without consequence. I was beyond the grasp of fear. For I had learned The Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"Do not roam among the haggard and the meek. Do not fight for scraps of food that are moist with stagnant rains. Do not enter the crucible of egoistic men who compete over dime and dollar. Rise, my student. And insist First upon the glory of Freedom. So that no arena can contain you. And no man can equal you. For your journey is unlike any other man in the field."

- Kapil Gupta
"Happiness is for fools."

- Kapil Gupta
"Miserable is what a man becomes when he hankers for happiness."

- Kapil Gupta
"You give me too much credit, student. I am more innocent than clever"

- Kapil Gupta
"Care is an inappropriate word. You must forgive me but I left that word behind long ago."

- Kapil Gupta
"Student, if you wish to learn, then learn. If you do not, then do not. But I will not imprison myself by the hope that you will."

- Kapil Gupta
"Emotional attachment comes out of the need for happiness."

- Kapil Gupta
"The freedom from Need."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is like a dagger. When it strikes you, it does something to you. The same way that man says “ouch” and reacts to something
painful."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is available to few men and also to all men."

- Kapil Gupta
"For there are enough men in the world who seek The Truth, and thus our halls will be selective, but certainly not empty."

- Kapil Gupta
"My dear student, why does one man devote his life to climbing Everest, while another doesn’t dare to leave his province? Why does one man seek to conquer the self, while another seeks to conquer the world? Why does one man seek to know Everything, while another is content with knowing what the world tells him? I apologize that I cannot provide you with a sincere answer to such questions, my student. I only know that it is so."

- Kapil Gupta
"Men who seek Truth have always been this way. If they look back into their childhood, they will find that they were Truth Seekers even then, in some form or fashion. Nature has a way of giving man exactly what he desires."

- Kapil Gupta
"One man digs because he has heard that if he digs, he might find water. Another man digs because the water that exists beneath the desert is something that he must find even if it kills him. From the outside, both toil. But one man’s toil is a toil for toil’s sake. While the other man’s toil is the centerpiece of his life."

- Kapil Gupta
"The man who toils for toils sake does so only to satisfy himself that he has “toiled,” as the world as told him to do. And if he does not find Truth, he is content to say that he did the necessary toil and still did not find it, and thus it wasn’t meant to be."

- Kapil Gupta
"Truth is a journey of the heart. And the Truth is bestowed upon a man by whisper or messenger."

- Kapil Gupta
"Nature is wiser than you think, my student. It tends to see through a man’s words."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Seeker Of Truth cannot help but to explore, my student. For him there is no choice. And because he has no choice but to find it, nature has no choice but to grant it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man feels inferior because he lives from the standpoint of his personality"

- Kapil Gupta
"As his personality, he is limited. And something within him recognizes that his personality is limited. And thus he must say and do things in order to make up for the deficiencies that he feels himself to possess."

- Kapil Gupta
"In the midst of others, he will find himself needing to say things that pad his own image. He will feel the need to say things that will heighten his importance in the eyes of others."

- Kapil Gupta
"That even the most casual meetings of men exist within an undercurrent of competitiveness. Each attempting subtle and clever ways to display verbiage and mannerisms in order to quell their inner feelings of ineptitude."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because of an overwhelming desire to know The Truth. So that they could live Uncompromisingly Free."

- Kapil Gupta
"The reason that you seek to be rescued is because living in Uncompromising Freedom is perhaps not a desire that has yet taken hold of you."

- Kapil Gupta
"The nature of your questions will change. And the person who will be asking them will be someone other than the one who asks them now."

- Kapil Gupta
"What is the answer that you would like to hear, my student?"

- Kapil Gupta
"When human beings ask a question, they are in hopes of receiving a certain type of answer. One that fits with their own view of things."

- Kapil Gupta
"Your words demonstrate wisdom, my student"

- Kapil Gupta
"I know the power of Instinct."

- Kapil Gupta
"They may know it. But they have not fallen in love with it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Nature is perfect. And that is why I love nature. Instinct belongs to nature. And so I love it, as well."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is knowing, and there is Knowing. There is knowing, and there is Loving."

- Kapil Gupta
"A man who brings his Instinct to battle will always have IT. A man who brings only his technique may have it or he may not."

- Kapil Gupta
"I Love instinct. I would not so much as walk to the garden without it."

- Kapil Gupta
"I suppose I would say that “work” is perhaps best spent getting in touch with your instinct. To crawl inside of it. To become intimate with it. So that it may serve you as it has served me."

- Kapil Gupta
"You feel inferiority because you have fallen for the false game, my student."

- Kapil Gupta
"The false game is to give legitimacy to the notion that there is a hierarchy of importance among human beings."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a man who is born is sure to one day die, what could possibly be of any “importance?” How can something that is fleeting carry any importance at all, my student?"

- Kapil Gupta
"If you create a category called “importance” you will naturally be compelled to populate this category. And then you will be compelled to create a hierarchy of “importance.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The moment you place yourself within this hierarchy, you will have created a problem."

- Kapil Gupta
"You will then suffer the weight of the hierarchy that sits above you"

- Kapil Gupta
"If you place yourself at the top, you will suffer the desperation of attempting to validate that position. And if you put yourself anywhere but the top, you will suffer the turmoil of having to reach a higher position. There is anxiety in both directions. For you are playing a game that you cannot win."

- Kapil Gupta
"Confidence, my student, is not a product of comparison. It is a product of indifference."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you are indifferent to what others think or believe about you, confidence will be with you."

- Kapil Gupta
"On the path to Wisdom, it is first imperative to let go of the “good.” For only then is it possible to let go of the “bad.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"If you fall for the trap of happiness, then you will forever be its slave."

- Kapil Gupta
"You would not be a heartless stone by becoming indifferent. For the indifference would be a product of having learned."

- Kapil Gupta
"The indifference would be the product of you having learned that nothing really matters in this life. When a man understands this, indifference is the natural byproduct."

- Kapil Gupta
"He doesn’t need to do anything. But if he chooses to do something, let it be for the purpose of Truly Experiencing It, rather than doing it for “meaning” and “purpose.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"If you try to convince someone, you are playing the false game. For the only reason you will be trying to convince them is in order to demonstrate the importance of your beliefs. But there is no importance at all."

- Kapil Gupta
"The madman has no need whatsoever to acquire confidence. For he is never without
it."

- Kapil Gupta
'The only part you can’t outsource is judgement.'

"For you, intelligence is something that you “possess.” As if intelligence were the contents, and you the container."

- Kapil Gupta
"The world views intelligence as imbibing “facts” and “know-how’s.” If a boy
does well in school, he is deemed “intelligent.” Is this not the case?"

- Kapil Gupta
"But what is taught in schools are the words of others. What is taught in schools is who fought which war in which year. What is taught in school is the process by which to do a mathematical equation. Or memorize facts."

- Kapil Gupta
"Then if a man contains something within his brain that is of Little Value, how
is it that a designation such as “intelligence” can be bestowed upon him?"

- Kapil Gupta
"If “intelligence” is that act of containing numerous facts, then an
encyclopedia must be deemed the most intelligent entity in existence. Is this not so, my student?"

- Kapil Gupta
"If they wish to plow a trade, they may procure a degree. But what does this have to do with “intelligence,” my dear student?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Intelligence is not Knowledge. Intelligence is not the accumulation of facts. Intelligence is not following instructions. Intelligence is not procuring a degree or becoming certified or passing an exam."

- Kapil Gupta
"Intelligence, my dear student, is something that is attained by way of Instinct rather than Knowledge."

- Kapil Gupta
"Intelligence comes from a place beyond the human mind. And it comes to a man by way of Availability moreso than by “study” or “hard work.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"When a man has a genuine desire to know The Truth, he deems himself available to knowing it. And thus the Universe infuses it into his bloodstream."

- Kapil Gupta
"My dear student, while the legions of men have spent their lives learning how to cup their hands so that they may carry a few ounces of water, the wise man searches for the Ocean. And once he has found it, he need never carry water again."

- Kapil Gupta
"What will I do with happiness, my student?"

- Kapil Gupta
"What is the need to be happy?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Then can it be settled that sadness must not be the opposite of happiness?"

- Kapil Gupta
"For the first part of my life, I too chased happiness. But then one day, I saw
through the game."

- Kapil Gupta
"Happiness is a chase. And nothing more."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perhaps you should ask those who chase it. If they feel that chasing happiness has made them happy, then perhaps it is worthwhile for them."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that to chase happiness is to chase a ghost."

- Kapil Gupta
"Examine the nature of your journey. Have a stark look at what your beliefs have brought you. And decide for yourself."

- Kapil Gupta
"I try not to have opinions, my student."

- Kapil Gupta
"I subscribe only to The Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"You will think me difficult, but I do not have any need for belief"

- Kapil Gupta
"this Truth comes by way of a nuanced and uncompromising exploration of my experiences."

- Kapil Gupta
I have no interest in resorting to “opinion” or “belief.”
If I know, I know. If I do not know, I explore and I experiment until I know
"What I have come to know is that chasing happiness is to forever hope for circumstances to go your way."

- Kapil Gupta
"We are bound to remain unhappy. And because we are bound to remain unhappy, we get stuck in this chase for happiness. It is a merry-go-round"

- Kapil Gupta
"Telling a man to “live in the present” is like telling him to scale the north face of Everest with his bare hands. It is silly advice."

- Kapil Gupta
"My dear student, I live in the moment because I have Discovered it. Not because someone told me to live in it."

- Kapil Gupta
"It must come from your heart. You must discover it through Genuineness. It can only be discovered by way of Sincerity."

- Kapil Gupta
"It has taken me many years to learn what Living really is, my student. I have slowly abandoned the idea of living FOR something. I seek rather to Experience."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have learned that thought is a liar."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have learned that feeling is closer to truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have learned that human beings chase and chase, until their lives are no more."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have learned that there are many places to visit, but nowhere to go."

- Kapil Gupta
"The relentlessness of life. The unforgiveness of nature. The insatiable momentum of the mind. The endless pains."

- Kapil Gupta
"For anything that is pursued with Sincerity does not fail. And anything that is pursued with hope always fails."

- Kapil Gupta
"My life is no longer “my life.” It is a Living"

- Kapil Gupta
"Living, my student, can only occur once one is free of the Mind. Living can only happen once he has crawled out from under its thumb. Therein lies a man’s Freedom"

- Kapil Gupta
"M: If you seek a prediction from me, the chances are not good."

- Kapil Gupta
"When desperation hits you, come to me."

- Kapil Gupta
"Then you will live a pitiable life. You will live the life of a prisoner. And you will never become Free."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because desperation has not yet risen within you."

- Kapil Gupta
"When life becomes unbearable. When you can no longer bear the weight of the mind. When Freedom is the only choice that remains for you. It is then that desperation will arise."

- Kapil Gupta
"Yes, I came to understand Life. But only after I had wasted more than half of it. For as long as I have breath in these lungs, never shall I waste another day."

- Kapil Gupta
"There was a time when my eyes were as closed as yours.
And yet I insisted that they were open."

- Kapil Gupta
"For fools, life can only be a struggle."

- Kapil Gupta
"Recognizing that my life never ceased to be a struggle. And recognizing that this could not be The Way were the realizations that began to open my eyes."

- Kapil Gupta
"Something is “beautiful” only within a background of ugliness. I saw what
Was."

- Kapil Gupta
"Do not allow your mind to drift toward romantic illusions, my student."

- Kapil Gupta
"I saw The Truth. And the truth needs no beauty to enhance it."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have told you that your eyes are closed. And at the moment, this is your greatest Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"My dear student. If I told you how to open them, they would forever remain closed."
- Kapil Gupta
"Because you would forever be lost in an attempt to open them. And your entire life would pass you by."

- Kapil Gupta
"Live with the knowledge that your eyes are closed. And when that knowledge makes its way from your head to your heart, your eyes will slowly begin to open."

- Kapil Gupta
"You will see how pitiable your life was, having lived with your eyes closed."

- Kapil Gupta
"Desperation is good because it ensures you will listen. On the other hand, it is not so good, because you may listen too well."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because you are desperate, you will reach out and grab what I throw your way. In a way that you have never been willing to do before. But each thing that I throw to you, you will do it and “see if it works.” This will not allow you to see."

- Kapil Gupta
"You ask me for a prescription."

- Kapil Gupta
"I respected the genuineness of your original statement. You said, ‘I suffer all
sorts of emotional upheaval'. And yet you dishonor this genuine sentiment by asking for a prescription."

- Kapil Gupta
"Every creature in nature continually returns to the place they feel at home. Like a bee to nectar. Emotional upheaval feels at home in you. And you feel at home in it."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: When will the time be right?
M: When you are not so desperate to know.
S: But what is wrong with desperation?
M: It will cause you to listen too well."

- Kapil Gupta
"I can tell you exactly why your emotional upheaval comes. I can go far deeper than I have. But you see, my dear student, if I do so you will try to eliminate the thing which is causing it"

- Kapil Gupta
"If I tell you that your emotional upheaval is from Desiring, then you will try to eliminate desire. And in trying to eliminate desire, you will be fighting an uphill battle. And thus you will go nowhere."

- Kapil Gupta
"I understand, my dear student. Come again in the morning. And perhaps your desperation will have begun to heal. And when your mind is not looking, I will whisper to you a quiet and gentle Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"You will arrive at the place you were meant to go. Nature would not have it otherwise. But we will move delicately through the forest of the mind. So as not to snap a twig or rustle the leaves. Lest the mind hear our footsteps."

- Kapil Gupta
"Life, my student, is Pain."

- Kapil Gupta
"In all the years that you have lived, have you experienced more joy or more pain?"

- Kapil Gupta
"All human beings do the very same, my student. They try to improve. They try to become happier. They try to become more successful. They try to become healthier. They try to become wiser. They try to become better parents. They try to become better spouses. They try to make more money. And so on."

- Kapil Gupta
"My dear student, have you ever seen a Tree try to improve? Or a flower? Or a cloud? Or a bird? Or even the animal who roams the great forest?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Man lives in a perpetual state of Not Knowing. He lives in a perpetual state of Not Understanding. And thus he suffers. And oh how he suffers. His entire existence is mired by one pain after another. And his entire life is devoted to endless attempts at freeing himself from that pain."

- Kapil Gupta
"I discovered that my life was suffering. And that no matter what I tried, this suffering would never cease. Rather than trying to improve my condition or to become happier, I decided to go on a Journey to discover the roots of my suffering."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Buddha is correct. But this message will not be understood by Man. For man needs an understanding that is more Immediate, more acute, more relatable to his everyday affairs."

- Kapil Gupta
"In order for a Man to truly cure anything, he must come face to face with the full gravity of the problem. For it is only then that a Sincere Motivation arises in his heart."

- Kapil Gupta
"Not every man will be willing to see such a thing. But a few certainly will."

- Kapil Gupta
"He must understand that no matter what he tries, whether it is meditation or psychotherapy or medications or support from friends, such things will not have the power to cure his pain. All efforts will be futile. This is what he must understand. And he must understand it deep within his heart."

- Kapil Gupta
"He must understand that no matter what he tries, whether it is meditation or psychotherapy or medications or support from friends, such things will not have the power to cure his pain."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will be like the dog that forever chases its tail."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because it does not understand that the tail was not designed to be caught."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man chases “happiness.” But in actuality, he doesn’t chase happiness at all. He chases freedom from pain."

- Kapil Gupta
Any man should ask himself, In the last 24 hours, how much True Joy did he experience How about 48 hours Or 72 hours Or two months Or twenty years It is all pain, my dear student. A man’s life is saturated by Pain.
"Becoming a Master is not a lofty thing, my student. Nor is it noble. Or spiritual. Or religious. It is Practical. It is a Necessity. To Truly Know. To experience The Real Truth. To Understand. So that one may be Free."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Master is one who is Unperturbed. Who is a leader of men without harboring the slightest interest in leading them."

- Kapil Gupta
"Then do not fall prey to “the world,” my student. It is an enormously powerful distraction. And the greatest form of “the world” is your very own Mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"I would like to hear about the well from which this question sprang."

- Kapil Gupta
"Without an ounce of fear, my student. This master of yours will never judge you."

- Kapil Gupta
"We mustn’t just try to help a man simply in exchange for monetary reward. We must absolutely pour our life into him."

- Kapti Gupta
"I am sympathetic to the way you feel, my student. I have never denied The Truth. And I cannot deny it now. The things that you say are indeed Fact."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is about Understanding, my dear student. It is about seeing things as they are. Seeing human beings as they are."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because people are caught up in the momentum of their own lives, student. It is not that they are unkind. It is just that their face is buried so deep in the constant happenings of their own lives that they rarely look up. They do not care about me or you. Nor should they."

- Kapil Gupta
"The hard truth is that no one cares about you. No one cares about me. People only care about themselves."

- Kapil Gupta
"Selfishness is not evil."

- Kapil Gupta
"The vast majority of people in the world are selfish. Very, very, very few are not. But they do exist."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you give them a drop, they will give you an ocean in return. Not because you ask or hope or even expect (never expect). They do it because it is in their nature to do so."

- Kapil Gupta
"Did the human beings who come to us for help Ask Us to think about them day and night? Did they Ask Us to spend our own time thinking of ways to transform them? We do this of our own accord, my student."

- Kapil Gupta
"We are not to be condemned. But nor are we to be congratulated."

- Kapil Gupta
"Do not try to be benevolent. Understand that whatever you do, the chances of you being Reciprocated beyond the minimum are almost Zero."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you wish to think about ways to transform someone even when they are not sitting before you, then do it. If you do not, then do not. You are not being “unkind” if you don’t. And you are not being “kind” if you do."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is ego in Martyrdom, so do not become a Martyr, my student."

- Kapil Gupta
"You are confused because you hope. And this hope causes you to question and to strategize."

- Kapil Gupta
"Understand that the chances of you encountering A Rare Gem Human Being amidst the common pebbles are akin to you being struck by lightning four times in the same afternoon."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have no faith in humanity, my student. Because I understand that humanity is like the sand that shifts with the incoming tide. There is nothing to have faith in."

- Kapil Gupta
"If the reason that you play is to win, I will not try to dissuade you."

- Kapil Gupta
"I could go into such things, student. But it will only lead you toward a mass of questions."

- Kapil Gupta
"Winning and losing are, for me, one and the same"

- Kapil Gupta
"Student, if I played to win, I would not be able to play."

- Kapil Gupta
"The only one who can truly Play is the one who is indifferent to winning and losing. He who plays to win suffers the wrath of the mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"There was a time that I not only sought to win, but to crush my opponent. And as sure as I stand before you, those were the most tumultuous years of my life."

- Kapil Gupta
"I won my share. But the price I paid for the win turned out to be too high a price for me."

- Kapil Gupta
"When I played to win, I lost my Freedom. I was filled with angst. I was fully invested in hope. Hoping, at each turn, that fortune would turn away from my opponent, and toward me. While winning did produce a pleasant feeling within me, it was fleeting."

- Kapil Gupta
"Toward any ideology that causes me to lose my Freedom. Never again will I stray from that which I hold dearest. The Mind is a voracious animal, my student. It will eat you alive."

- Kapil Gupta
"Only the fool trains in order to win. The wise man trains in order to forge his Spirit. He trains in order to perfect his skill. For his craft is his life. And its refinement is his Journey. A Journey toward perfecting himself."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Legend is not the one who prevails in battle. For any fool can secure a win."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Legend is the one who fights without an ounce of Fear. For he has nothing to lose. The Legend is the one whose heart does not increase its tempo. The Legend is the one who trains his skill in order to forge his spirit, so that neither nature nor misfortune can so much as lay a hand upon him."

- Kapil Gupta
"(Force) Training is of no use until one has the Sincere Intention to achieve such a thing."

- Kapil Gupta
"When a man Genuinely values his Freedom above all else, then he is Ready."

- Kapil Gupta
"Losses will scar you. Close battles will make you nervous. Anxiety will wrap its tentacles around you."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perhaps it will happen in this lifetime, student. Or perhaps in the next. Such a Journey appeals to very few men."

- Kapil Gupta
"I do not have an answer for why a path to Freedom captures the heart of so few men. Perhaps it is Karmic."

- Kapil Gupta
"The medical establishment sees only one face of depression. And both you and they fail to see the True face of depression."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have yet to meet a man or a woman who Is Not depressed."

- Kapil Gupta
"Trust not the face that man shows to the world. He has had much practice in concealing himself. He projects a certain image to the world, yet this image is vastly different in the quiet of his home."

- Kapil Gupta
"Depression is not only sadness and lack of energy and suicidal thoughts. It is living under the weight of the mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"Each and every man who lives under the weight of the mind suffers an ongoing and incessant undercurrent of turmoil. His daily life consists of worry, fear, irritability, and concern. He lives in uncertainty. He lives with an unstable mood. He suffers conflicts. He succumbs to anger. His heart races with the subtlest thing that does not go his way. Such is the poison of depression."

- Kapil Gupta
"The medical establishment sees “patients.” It does not see human beings. It treats “disease.” It knows not of Ease or Dis-ease."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man has little choice but to live in dis-ease."

- Kapil Gupta
"Never trust a man who tells you that he isn’t depressed. Do not argue with him. Simply nod your head and smile."

- Kapil Gupta
"He does not even realize that he is depressed. It would be improper for you to disturb a man."

- Kapil Gupta
"Never try to awaken a sleepwalker"

- Kapil Gupta
"Only a depressed man could invent such a thing. And only a depressed
man chooses to consume alcohol."

- Kapil Gupta
"That alcohol is consumed in order to escape the pain of the mind. Man craves an altered state. Because the one that he continually finds himself within is far too turbulent. Alcohol has been become man’s answer to the pain of the mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"Rare is the man who does not consume alcohol. And the only way that he would stop is if the pain of the mind began to cease. Then he would not have anything to have a respite from."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man does not listen to other men. Unless he arrives at a state in which he is Truly Ready to walk a new path. When his current way of living is no longer acceptable to him, he will come."

- Kapil Gupta
"What if I told you that your potential was very limited? That you would only amount to such and such, and never anything more?"

- Kapil Gupta
"What if I told you that your potential was glorious. That you would ascend to the greatest of heights, higher than any man before you?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Student, what good is any Truth that destroys the will of a human being?"

- Kapil Gupta
"You see, my student, man has a habit of asking non-questions. He states phrases in a question’s cloak."

- Kapil Gupta
"Your personality is immaterial, student."

- Kapil Gupta
"Personality has nothing to do with Potential."

- Kapil Gupta
"The lazy man is a sloth. The hard working man is a mule. There is little qualitative difference between them."

- Kapil Gupta
"The world sees nobility in hard work. I do not."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is far easier to be slothful or hard working than it is to be a Seeker."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is no dignity in toil, when the Truth is available."

- Kapil Gupta
"The world believes that man should become effortful so as to achieve the highest result."

- Kapil Gupta
"But tell me student, is it not wiser to find a way to achieve an even greater result with a fraction of the work?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The fact that you are horrified by this question demonstrates that you’ve succumbed to the culture."

- Kapil Gupta
"The ones who Know do a fraction of the work, and achieve infinitely greater results. For their dignity lies in knowing The Truth, rather than aiming for sweat and toil."

- Kapil Gupta
"The only thing that remains are empty ideals to turn man into a mule. Doing well in school only gets you more school. It has no life. It has no practical value."

- Kapil Gupta
"What does it mean to be “educated?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"To the world, education is to memorize and recite a litany of irrelevant facts."

- Kapil Gupta
"To be Educated means to Know something of value. To Know something that can transform a human life."

- Kapil Gupta
"My initial instinct is to explain the incredible potential of human beings. But such things will not penetrate you. Because they are not in your experience."

- Kapil Gupta
"Even listing these things will become prescriptive. And thus you will be certain not to pursue them."

- Kapil Gupta
"A man must somehow accumulate a basic level of disgust for the status quo. If he is not disgusted by it, he will become a part of it"

- Kapil Gupta
"He must have a love for attaining Clarity. He must become haunted by what he might not know. Then he has a chance of moving toward his potential."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: I understand, Master. Before you go, please tell me this. Is it veritably true that I can become absolutely anything that I wish to become?

M: The answer was initially Yes. But now that you have asked the question, it has instantly become No."

- Kapil Gupta
"The true fit of frustration should be that you stand before a man who can give you these things this very minute. However, even having been given them, you are not ready to hear them."

- Kapil Gupta
"Such things are not given to those who are Loyal. They are given to those who are Ready"

- Kapil Gupta
"You were not of the right mind to hear the questions he asked. The questions that he asked could only have been asked by one who is Ready."

- Kapil Gupta
"You are not interested in the Truths, student. You are only interested in hearing them."

- Kapil Gupta
"What is most valuable to you is that you Receive Them. You are more interested in receiving the Gift of Truth, than you are in receiving the Truths themselves. This is why you have become envious of the old man. For he Received them, while you did not."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is not a matter of “how,” my student. When a man is Ready, the clouds part. The town bell rings slightly off tune. The air around him grows thick."

- Kapil Gupta
"Your eyes will reveal your readiness, student."

- Kapil Gupta
"Every problem in your life exists because you fail to see it for what it truly is. All that you have ascribed it to is incorrect. If you were, for a single moment, able to see these problems for what they Truly were, every one of them would vanish before your next breath."

- Kapil Gupta
"He can live his life through wisdom."

- Kapil Gupta
"Is it easy to live a life of pain, my student?"

- Kapil Gupta
"It is a great tragedy that the whole of a man’s existence is spent living in pain. Even that which he thinks is fortuitous is also pain. It is a terrible way to live."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is not that attaining wisdom is so difficult. It is just that man is simply unwilling to separate himself from his ego."

- Kapil Gupta
"What you must understand, student, is that in his view, a man’s ego is all he has. It is his foundation. It is the place from which he acts, and from which he sees the world. How can one ask him to separate himself from such a thing?"

- Kapil Gupta
"In the traditions and the ways of the world, men are preached at. They are instructed to do this and that. Whether it is in the name of spirituality, religion, self development, psychotherapy, or otherwise."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because they look upon man as one who is to be “instructed.” You will see that although men may hear such “sermons” and “instructions” and “psychologizing”, few follow them."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man must be understood. He must be respected. Before you ask a man to be wise, the one speaking to him must act in wisdom. He must not instruct. He must look at things from the man’s point of view."

- Kapil Gupta
"If in his eyes a man views his ego as part and parcel of himself, he will not let it go. No matter what holy figure asks him to do so. It is not about “instructions.” It is about understanding."

- Kapil Gupta
"The fact is that almost all are doomed. But there is the rare man who will consider it"

- Kapil Gupta
"There are many reasons. Too many to explain. But, for one, his unwillingness to continue living a life of pain."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is not whether or not this separation will be painful. It is whether he feels that this pain will be lesser or greater than an entire life of pain."

- Kapil Gupta
"Pain. Turmoil. Emotional attachment. Swings of mood. Constant and endless anxiety. All manner of internal strife. I no longer had use for such things"

- Kapil Gupta
"In the beginning it feels wonderful. Because the memories of the old life remain fresh. They remain as a dark background against this new found Freedom."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why is it that you do not have Quiet, my student?

It is because you seek selective Quiet."

- Kapil Gupta
"Life is designed in a particular way. The Mind is designed in a particular way. You must take it all. Or leave it all. But selectivity is to introduce duality. And duality is the lifeblood of the mind that torments you."

- Kapil Gupta
"But to a man of wisdom, it is hardly a choice at all."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because the man of wisdom has seen enough. He has had enough. And he will be fooled or tempted no more."

- Kapil Gupta
"The man of wisdom has seen that all joys are followed by misery. All pleasures are followed by pain. He has seen the undeniable reproducibility of this fact. And thus he has grown tired of seeking pleasure. And in so doing he has become immune to the pain that follows."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: And this man of wisdom attains quiet how?
M: He does not need to attain it at all. It becomes his"

- Kapil Gupta
"Because he has relinquished the causes, he no longer suffers the effects. If you are no longer interested in “good” things, “bad” things cannot disturb you."

- Kapil Gupta
"Not if you see that five bad things follow each good one. It doesn’t require an overly intelligent or “spiritual” individual to see this. It requires only an observant one."

- Kapil Gupta
"My dear student, the greatest thing that can possibly happen to me has already happened."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Freedom from the need to seek anything."

- Kapil Gupta
"Certainly, I continue to refine those things. But the refinement is the joy. Not the hope that something “good” will come from it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because if it does not bring about a glorious and consistent result, then it means I have not yet found The Truth. So I continue to refine."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth always comes of its own accord."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Way is not a map. It is a Quality."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you Wait, you will be a beggar who deserves nothing. If you Work, you will be a mule who attains nothing. You must seek to Understand, student."

- Kapil Gupta
"This astute and incisive observation is borne of the Genuine Desire to be immune to all things that life has to offer. Most especially the “good” things."

- Kapil Gupta
"Whether God exists or not, I do not know. But I do not trouble myself looking for him."

- Kapil Gupta
"The only reason human beings wish to know about God is because they want something from him. If it was believed that God did not have the power to give, I do not believe any human being on earth would ever utter his name."

- Kapil Gupta
"If there were a God, would he not know that his children are craving peace, happiness, and freedom?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Does the sun need to be asked to gives its warmth? Do the rivers need to be asked to quench a man’s thirst? Does nature not give itself whole to any and all living creatures, whether they ask or not?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Then if there is a God, why would he wait to be asked to give something that he already knows is desperately needed?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Because once a man becomes Enlightened, he loses awareness of himself. But that is not what you are seeking."

- Kapil Gupta
"You are seeking the pleasure that comes from becoming Enlightened."

- Kapil Gupta
"Once a human being becomes Enlightened, there is no one to receive the pleasure."

- Kapil Gupta
"The world has filled you with silly ideas, my student."

- Kapil Gupta
"M: I will help you, my student.

S: How?

M: By ignoring the question you asked, and answering the question you did not."

- Kapil Gupta
"I am going to answer the question that you want to ask but do not know how to ask it."

- Kapil Gupta
"M: The experience that you seek can be found.
S: How?
M: By choosing to live in Oblivion."

- Kapil Gupta
"Oblivion can give you what your false notions of Enlightenment cannot."

- Kapil Gupta
"It means to live Oblivious to all that you know in your head, feel in your heart, and see with your eyes."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: But if I become oblivious, I will no longer know anything.
M: You will know Completely and Precisely."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: But if I become oblivious, I will not see what is around me.
M: You will see for the first time in your life."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: But if I become oblivious, I will not be able to plan, formulate, and create a life.
M: You will utilize perfectly measured doses of the utilitarian mind in order to achieve all ends you wish to achieve. Without the compulsory emotional turmoil that accompanies them."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: I suspect there is More to Oblivion than you are letting on.

M: Certainly. But let this be an introduction to this new way of life. For it is a secret passage way to “instant Enlightenment.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Words cannot express."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is no beginning. All things fold into themselves."

- Kapil Gupta
"The ambivalence lies in getting across to you the fact that Truths reveal themselves in measured doses. In the realm of experience."

- Kapil Gupta
"I see the innocent look in your eye, and thus I will try. I think at the end of this exchange you perhaps will understand."

- Kapil Gupta
"Yes. But do not become excited, my student. For the thing that you will perhaps understand is not exactly what you hope to understand."

- Kapil Gupta
"Ask any question that you like. And I will answer it. But I will warn you, the answers may not satisfy you. But they will be The Truth. This I can assure you."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Is there a God?

M: No."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is enlightenment?

M: The holistic dissolution of the self."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is the mind?

M: Ego."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: How does one achieve happiness?

M: There is no such thing."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: From where does wisdom arise?

M: Dispassionate observation."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: How can I have Peace?

M: By living without the mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: How do I learn to love myself?

M: This will only create more problems for you."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is the most important thing in life?

M: Nothing has importance."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is the best way to spend one’s life?

M: It depends upon the end one wishes to achieve."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is love?

M: Not what you believe it to be."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What makes you happy?

M: Nothing."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What makes you sad?

M: I do not allow myself the luxury of sadness."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is it that you seek above all else?

M: Vairagya (Dispassion)."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is Art?

M: The fingertips having a mind of their own."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What does life give to human beings?

M: A steady stream of pain."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Is this pessimistic?

M: Yes. For the optimist."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Is the optimist not better than the pessimist?

M: There is no difference."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: How can I help the world?

M: By discovering Yourself."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: How can world wars be stopped?

M: By dismantling all governments."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: How to stop world hunger?

M: Man is hungry for something other than food. And once the hungry are sufficiently fed, they will exchange the disease of hunger for the diseases of those who are satiated."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Will I become a Master?

M: No.

S: Why not?

M: Because you asked."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is the most dangerous human emotion?

M: Hope."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: How do we get others to like us?

M: No one cares about You."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Do you care about me?

M: No."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Do you not have room in your heart for anyone?

M: A pint of blood."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Forgive me, but this sounds rather cold.

M: Nothing to forgive."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: I wish to be with you always. Is this possible?

M: No."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Is there anything in this world worth living for?

M: No."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Then what is the aim of a man’s life?

M: To become enlightened.

S: Why?

M: Because the alternative is an endless torrent of misery."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is your idea of enlightenment.

M: A dissolution of the self."

 - Kapil Gupta
"S: Why would anyone choose to dissolve himself?

M: Why would anyone choose to live a life of untold turmoil?"

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is it that gives you True Satisfaction?

M: I will admit a guilty morsel of pleasure.

S: Please tell me, Master.

M: A handful of True, Authentic, and Genuine students who seek to become True Masters."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What does it mean to become a Master.

M: To live a life completely free of even the slightest trace of turmoil."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Is such a thing possible?

M: Not for the one who wonders."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: How did you come to be so uncompromising?

M: This I learned from life. Which is endlessly uncompromising."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Are you touched by ambition?

M: Unfortunately, to a degree."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is your ambition?

M: My passion for guiding Genuine Seekers."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What do you hate?

M: I hate when I allow myself to hate. And when I allow myself to hate, I do so voluntarily, and inadvertently release myself from the hate."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is one particular holy grail that you train yourself to achieve?

M: A beautiful question."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: One I would love to know the answer to, Master.

M: To arrive at the state in which even the Thought of things to be other than the way they are fail to arise within my mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Is it possible to have everything?

M: To need nothing is to have everything."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is your default state?

M: Incisive observation into the way things are at this moment."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is fear?

M: The offspring of desire."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: What is anger?

M: The offspring of hope."

"How you feel determines how you play. What you think determines how you feel"

"After the match ends, you will be high on emotion after a win, or disappointed after a loss. What I am saying is that although you have paid the price 100% of the time, you have likely won far less than 100% of the time."

"Pay today for a better tomorrow, is that it?

Do you disagree with that?"

- Kapil Gupta

"All that you believe you know is false. Your education, your societal status, your accomplishments and your degrees may serve you well in society."

- Kapil Gupta
"Your knowledge, your perceptions, your preferences and prejudices stand as a gargantuan wall that separates you from the world of peace. They are your cocoon."

- Kapil Gupta
"For it is only the one who does not know who is willing to go on a search."

- Kapil Gupta
"Your intelligence binds you to your ego. And your ego to yourself. And within this self you have rotted for many lifetimes."

- Kapil Gupta

"If a man is blissful, he can be certain that he is living a life. He can be certain that he has learned how to live. If he is not, there are questions that he must ask."

"A wonderful contrast is to watch a child."

- Kapil Gupta
"The adult lives in yesterdays and tomorrows. The reason he does so is because he feels that there is something to come. The child lives squarely within today. Because, for him, all that might come has already arrived."

- Kapil Gupta
"The child lives beyond the mind. Until he is taught otherwise."

- Kapil Gupta
"Until he learns the habits of those around him. And soon the colors begin to fade. And where he once saw life, he now sees images. That which once raised questions, now produces assumptions."

"When you had a positive thought it made you feel better, right? But how many seconds did it take for the negative thoughts to return?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The zone has nothing to do with mental toughness. The zone is not about calming the mind, controlling the mind, appeasing the mind, or taming the mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"The zone is not a state of a strong mind, a quiet mind, or a calm mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"The zone is a state of No Mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"When you experienced those tranquil, effortless days in which you accessed the zenith of your skill, it was because you had transcended the mind. Purely by accident. You did not have positive thoughts or happy thoughts. You had NO THOUGHTS."

- Kapil Gupta
"Can we get into the zone at will? Certainly. But it will cost you something that you may not be willing to pay: Your intelligence. The deep-seated belief which says that YOU KNOW."

- Kapil Gupta
"Understanding the state of no mind will be more about
unlearning rather than learning."

"Can you do it? Can you make yourself available to existence? Can you let go of the knowledge of which you are so proud? Can you allow yourself Just To Be? Can you allow yourself to regress into childhood? Wholly new and innocent?"

"If you feel such a fear, I assure you that the game you are afraid to lose is not the one you think you are playing."

Because they became."

"I have never seen an athlete who did not live in fear."

"Wise is he who sees this as Truth, rather than humility"

- Kapil Gupta
"He is forever on a desperate hunt For validation and praise."

- Kapil Gupta
"No matter the empty words that society parrots, A man is never enough in his own eyes."

- Kapil Gupta
"For where there is a self,
There will always be a deficiency."

- Kapil Gupta
"No matter how much a man may improve,
He can never be enough."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will never be able to remove every grain of dust from the
ocean.

He will never be able to remove every streak of smoke from
the sky."

- Kapil Gupta
"A man does not improve himself,
He improves only his self-image."

- Kapil Gupta
"The intelligent man is nothing without the unintelligent.
The successful man is nothing without the unsuccessful."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is that nothing is attained by seeking it."

- Kapil Gupta
"When pleasure is not at hand, the human pursues an action that will give him a dose of it."

- Kapil Gupta
"In what way would a human being never become bored? Is such a thing possible?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Nature is not a fool."

- Kapil Gupta
"For all techniques are about the technique itself.

A bridge back to itself."

- Kapil Gupta
"What he desires is the prescriptions and the techniques.

Because practicing prescriptions and techniques serves to create the self image that the human seeks to create. For himself and for others."

- Kapil Gupta
"A human being lives in a house for twenty years, without truly seeing the house."

- Kapil Gupta
"Humans live with other humans for the whole of their lives.

Without ever seeing them."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is simply that Which Is.

And that Which Is Not."

- Kapil Gupta
"Peace exists nowhere in the world."

- Kapil Gupta
"Peace, like freedom, exists in seeing things the way that they naturally exist."

- Kapil Gupta
"Peace lies in the natural desire to see the Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man lives under a guillotine of “right and wrong.”

Society, the mind, and the world hold this idea over his head."

- Kapil Gupta
"A life devoted to the procurement of pleasure

Is a life lived in endless pain."

- Kapil Gupta
"Peace is not found in the company of others

Doing for others

Needing for others

Or relying upon others."

- Kapil Gupta
"He is a scapegoat for man’s failures.

He is a repository for man’s endless needs.

He is a well without water."

- Kapil Gupta
"Peace lives inside of Truth.

Truth lives inside of no man.

Truth is truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth lies not in facing things

The Truth lies not in fleeing them."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is the recognition of what there is to face

And what is creating the compulsion to flee."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth lies not in the pursuit of success.

For success itself chases seriousness and sincerity"

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth lies not in kindness or compassion.

Such things arise naturally

When a man gains freedom from his lifelong burdens."

- Kapil Gupta
"Peace is not found from people

It is found away from them."

- Kapil Gupta
"Peace is not found in the world

It is found despite the world."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is the only thing that “works.”

Because it is the only thing there Is."

- Kapil Gupta
"Winning by competing is anxiety. It is not art. It destroys the human’s internal peace."

- Kapil Gupta
"Winning with brute force is violence. It is not art. And thus not sustainable."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is an art, which if it is learned, allows one to have the world at his feet.

It is the art of Kings, the art of Legends."

- Kapil Gupta
"Winning with brute force is violence. It is not art. And thus not sustainable."

- Kapil Gupta
"Winning by competing is anxiety. It is not art. It destroys the human’s internal peace."

- Kapil Gupta
"Winning by hope is fortune. It is not art. And fortune is as fickle as the wind"

- Kapil Gupta
"Winning for pleasure is ego. It is not art. It enslaves one to a life of chasing a satisfaction he will never come to own."

- Kapil Gupta
"The question of “how to beat another” does not interest me."

- Kapil Gupta
"The question of “what techniques to employ to calm yourself under pressure” does not interest me."

- Kapil Gupta
"What interests me is How to win without trying."

- Kapil Gupta
"How to attract without desiring.

And how to have without needing."

- Kapil Gupta
"Without the soil being tilled in a particular way and to a sufficient depth, the words cannot be understood beyond the level of the intellect."

- Kapil Gupta
"A thing which is not understood beyond the level of the intellect, is not understood at all."

- Kapil Gupta
"Winning without trying is an investment and an immersion into learning about that which keeps one from disappearing into the void."

- Kapil Gupta
"Retreat from the world is a necessity for the one who seeks to become a Legend."

- Kapil Gupta
"Parenting is not about doing “good” to children."

- Kapil Gupta
"Parenting is not about trying to make children “happy.”

This is a reactive need of the parent.

The need for himself to feel happy."

- Kapil Gupta
"In what way does a parent achieve peace and freedom?

By perfecting Himself."

- Kapil Gupta
"Behavior is but the peripheral-most branch on a tree.

A tree can only be affected at its root.

Behavior is an effect."

- Kapil Gupta
"Attempting to modify an effect is to spend the whole of one’s life putting out fires."

- Kapil Gupta
"The parent who perfects himself is the one who is able to most effectively parent, without “parenting.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is that even a man who but treads upon the journey toward perfecting oneself, achieves untold rewards."

- Kapil Gupta
"While the one who walks the path of “self-improvement” experiences stops and starts, improvements and regressions, forever."

- Kapil Gupta
"It means that one must find within him the seeds of Reactivity. For all reactions, “good” or “bad,” have a consequence downstream."

- Kapil Gupta
"The remainder will continue on with their lives, under the impenetrable assumption that attachment is “natural” and perhaps even “good.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"A child that is not leaned upon is free."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is no wrong or right.

There is only cause and effect."

- Kapil Gupta
"For a parent who needs his child to succeed can never be free."

- Kapil Gupta
"As for respect, it is a natural tendency for humans to reflexively give what they receive."

- Kapil Gupta
"It could be argued that, in a sense, the most effective parent is the one who has a child and essentially walks away and monitors him from a distance."

- Kapil Gupta
"World Creates Mind. Mind Creates Human"

- Kapil Gupta
"The human is under the impression that these thoughts and feelings belong to “him.”

If the thoughts and feelings boost his ego, he grows prideful of them."

- Kapil Gupta
"One’s environment shapes the structure of the mind.

The mind shapes the structure of the human.

In essence, the world creates the mind.

The mind creates the human."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will treat the air around him as if he were attempting to quarantine himself from an Ebola outbreak.

For he will have come to understand that the “societal virus” is one hundred times more potent."

- Kapil Gupta
"For once the mind is shaped, it is shaped forever.

Once the human is shaped, he is shaped forever.

Once shaped, his life will exist within the crucible of “mistakes” and “therapies.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"A human is a product of his continual exposures.

He becomes That to which he is most often exposed."

- Kapil Gupta
"Has only two options before him.

Either he retreats into isolation.

Or he scours the world in order to find the one human who speaks The Truth, and continually exposes himself to him."

- Kapil Gupta
"There are no “deals.”

There is only IS and IS NOT."

- Kapil Gupta
"Nature sets things in black and white."

- Kapil Gupta
"It requires 100 degrees for the boiling of water.

It has no sympathy for 99.

It has no praise for 101."

- Kapil Gupta
"What exists?

What does not?

What is fantasy?

What is reality?"

- Kapil Gupta
"That which does not exist in the mind, does not exist at all.

All of the things a man thinks, feels, strives for, runs from, chases, and deliberates upon is Mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"Tell a man that his life is a reality fabricated by his mind, and he instantly reverts to talk of “the matrix.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Man converses with more people in his mind than he ever does in his life."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man converses with more people in his mind than he ever does in his life."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a man is lying on the side of the road with his limb torn from his body after being struck by a car, he has no life problems or relationship problems or money problems or philosophy problems."

- Kapil Gupta
"If he awakens from the coma and has lost his memory, even then these problems do not bother him.

But as his memories return, his identity returns."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is that a man who has no identity is the most effective human being in the world."

- Kapil Gupta
"He holds onto nothing. For there is no substrate in which to house anything."

- Kapil Gupta
"The world is chasing “mindfulness.”

But Truth lies in Mindlessness."

- Kapil Gupta
"The man who knows not who he is does not suffer.

The one who suffers is the one who believes himself to be this or that."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man is born pure and nameless.

And these are the most blissful days of his life.

Little does he know, that he will never for the rest of his life experience such bliss."

- Kapil Gupta
"That which does not exist in the mind, does not exist at all.

The thought that does not arise, can bring no turmoil."

- Kapil Gupta
"Positive thinking binds a man just as much as negative thinking."

- Kapil Gupta
"The man who learns to think gains benefits in the world.

The man who learns to stop thinking gains a glory beyond all worldly rewards."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth can only be seen without the blindfold of thoughts.

A person, a place, or a thing can only be seen when one has freed himself from the spell of the mind.

And in seeing it, it is neither ugly nor beautiful.

For in seeing IT, one sees Himself!"

- Kapil Gupta
"The thoughtless, nameless, concept-less man is in a rare and unique position.

He is in a position to Know All."

- Kapil Gupta
"For whatever he sees or touches contains no interference whatsoever.

Whatever he sees or touches leaves upon him no imprint of “significance.”

Thus he sees All, whilst holding onto Nothing.

Without trying to do either."

- Kapil Gupta
"So long as man views this Truth as “philosophical,” he will never come to realize it."

- Kapil Gupta
"One: The adherence to a construct in order to preserve an internal self-image.

Two: The need to be accepted by the world."

- Kapil Gupta
"Men are irrevocably bound by the idea of good and bad. They are tormented by the concept of right and wrong."

- Kapil Gupta
"Virtually all of a man’s actions are the result of reinforcing an internal self-image. These actions are triggered by fear on one hand, and validation on the other."

- Kapil Gupta
"These actions are an attempt to provide evidence to oneself. Evidence that he IS who he would like to be, and that he IS NOT whom he fears he might become."

- Kapil Gupta
"He does things for no other reason than to prove to himself that he is “good.”

He refrains from things for no other reason than to prove to himself that he is not “bad.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Even as he reads these words, he will begin to fear that he might soon be asked to do something that is not “good.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"He will begin to view these words with a suspicious eye. For if there is so much as a hint of anything that contests the unquestionable and iron-clad tenets of goodness and morality, he views it as false."

- Kapil Gupta
"He can only be subservient to the ideals that he attempts to “live up to.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The slightest hesitation, and the ripples appear."

- Kapil Gupta
"The slightest deliberation, and the stillness of the lake is shattered."

- Kapil Gupta
"To conditioned minds, the actions of an Effective Ruler may appear benevolent or unkind.

They may appear wise or foolish."

- Kapil Gupta
"But wisdom lies in understanding that the effectiveness of an action is not a function of its content, but of the source from which it arises."

- Kapil Gupta
"Truth Is The End Of All Chases"

- Kapil Gupta
"So long as there is a chase, attention cannot be placed in any sufficient manner upon that which needs to be paid attention to."

- Kapil Gupta
"One can only see what needs to be seen if there is a calm, unhurried, unpressured, and timeless opportunity to do so."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one is chasing success, he will not give himself the opportunity to understand The Game."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one is chasing happiness, he will not give himself the opportunity to understand the relationship between Suffering and Happiness."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one is chasing enlightenment, he will not give himself the opportunity to understand the emptiness behind the concept of Spirituality."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one is chasing validation, he will not give himself the opportunity to understand the nature of Ego."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one is chasing fame, he will not give himself the opportunity to understand the hole in his heart that causes him to search for fame."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man spends his entire life attempting to numb the pains of his inadequacies.

He is attracted to endless “competitions” in order to buy a moment’s worth of triumph."

- Kapil Gupta
"If man acts, it is a chase."

- Kapil Gupta
"If man acts, it is a chase.

If he does not act, he does so out of “principle.”

Both roads lead back to themselves."

- Kapil Gupta
"For an attempt to live up to a principle is also a chase. A chase to become “good,” “righteous,” “moral,” or “spiritual.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Everything in a man’s life is a chase."

- Kapil Gupta
"When he no longer has any interest in being good, right, moral, spiritual, righteous, or noble, he becomes a man who is ready to walk the path of Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"Things become available to him that are not available to his brethren.

Not because he has earned them or worked hard for them.

But because he has created the soil that is necessary for them to bloom.

- Kapil Gupta
"“What is it that I must see, that upon having seen it, I will never have to chase again?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"“What game is it that I am playing? What is it that will allow me to own it so completely, that I will never have to resort to competing?”"

- Kapil Gupta
""What will allow me to arrive at permanent satisfaction? So that I may never again be compelled to seek happiness?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"“What action could I take that would be completely free of an egoic motive?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The chaser seeks pleasures.

The Man of Truth seeks an Arrival. So that he may free himself from the pleasure-chase."

- Kapil Gupta
"The prescriptions he should use are also created by thought."

- Kapil Gupta
"As you are reading this now, you are beginning to catch a glimpse of man’s unfortunate plight of having to live in a world of thought.

And even this . . . is created by thought."

- Kapil Gupta
"The only entity that knows of time is the one who Keeps time.

The very one who Keeps it is the one who Created it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Time is present when thought is present.

If there is no thought, there is no time.

If there was no man, there would be no time."

- Kapil Gupta
"If man’s entire life is lost in a world of thought, then what in his life is truly real?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Thought is a habit of the mind. Mind is a habit of the ego.

Ego is a habit of the self.

And the self does not, in truth, exist."

- Kapil Gupta
"Therefore, there is nothing in a man’s life that is truly real.

For reality is the nameless, identity-less, mind-less, and thought-less Void."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man’s entire life is a chain of lies that spans three quarters of a century"

- Kapil Gupta
"I caution you not to become outraged by this.

For your outrage will be feigned and short-lived."

- Kapil Gupta
"One watches a world class golfer hit a shot.

He attempts to mimic the movement.

But he fails."

- Kapil Gupta
"The motion that one sees cannot be reproduced.

For it does not, in truth, exist."

- Kapil Gupta
"An attempt to correct a flaw at the level of the flaw is a failure
to understand the source of the flaw.

Most pain is referred pain."

- Kapil Gupta
"He hires an “instructor” to help him with his golf swing.

And, in so doing, he has sealed his fate.

From this point forward, he will become enslaved to this instructor."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is not that the golf swing is not flawed and in need of fixing.

It is that the golf swing does not exist!

There is no swing."

- Kapil Gupta
"He becomes a well-practiced novice.

But never a Master."

- Kapil Gupta
"How can any serious individual allow himself to succumb to following the “habits of successful people?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"A mastery of skill comes from a place that is deeper than the skill itself."

- Kapil Gupta
"A mastery of technique comes from a place other than the physicality of the movement."

- Kapil Gupta
"He sees what others do not see because the times that he did not see them have left an indelible impression upon him."

- Kapil Gupta
"The human body, you see, is not made to “technique.”

It is made to Respond and React."

- Kapil Gupta
"One does not become a Master by way of “technique training.”

One becomes a Master by way of Perception Training.

If the body knows The What, it creates its own HOW."

- Kapil Gupta
"The sort of How that no instructor in the history of the world would even think of, much less “teach.”

For these “how’s” are found in places that no man would ever think to look."

- Kapil Gupta
"Shall I reveal to you a Secret?

You will never become Warren Buffet.

Would you like to know why?

Because even Warren Buffet isn’t “Warren Buffet.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The Mastery of Skill arrives from understanding the Source from which things arise."

- Kapil Gupta
"For the smoke from a burning log travels many miles. And the smoke, is not the fire itself.

It arrives from the understanding that the eyes were meant to look rather than to See."

- Kapil Gupta
"Humans tend to hold onto things tightly.

This is a natural consequence of the belief in ownership."

- Kapil Gupta
"That which one believes to be “His,” imprisons him.

That which one “owns and possesses,” will become his greatest demon.

It will visit him in his nightmares."

- Kapil Gupta
"A man becomes that which he possesses.

It is for this reason, that he can never know Freedom."

- Kapil Gupta
"A man builds a business. The business generates a profit.

The man pockets the profit. And views it as “His.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"What is this relationship?

The relationship is one of attachment"

- Kapil Gupta
"Before pointing to another, perhaps he should ask himself if being envious is “good.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Humans live in varying degrees of disingenuousness and reactivity. They do not live in Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"Attachment is neither good nor bad."

- Kapil Gupta
"Rules do not give birth to obedience.

They give birth to Cleverness."

- Kapil Gupta
"An attachment to money (or anything else) is neither good nor bad. It is neither holy nor evil.

One is free to become attached.

It is just that . . .

He cannot become free While attached."

- Kapil Gupta
"The man who gives away his money out of a sense of obligation or an attempt to be holy or spiritual is as much a fool as the one who hoards it out of a sense of attachment and ownership."

- Kapil Gupta
"Much of a man’s actions are a reaction to shame. He dawns the cloak of that which is opposite to what he fears he has become."

- Kapil Gupta
"One’s actions do not make one holy.

For the Man of Truth has no use for action or holiness."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will be willing to see that this attachment forces his hand."

- Kapil Gupta
"A man says, “I built this business with my own hands and my own smarts. Therefore, it belongs to me.”

This is a most reasonable claim.

And quite frankly, it is best suited as a response against a society which attempts to take his money from him."

- Kapil Gupta
"Does a man’s money truly belong to him?"

- Kapil Gupta
"From where does a man’s intelligence arise? Did he Create it?

From where does his drive arise? Did he Manufacture it?

From where does his vision arise? Did he Assemble it?

From where does his instinct arise? Did he Build it?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Did He himself create such things?

And what of the endless serendipitous encounters?

What of the fortunes that happened to fall his way?

What of the stars that aligned in his favor?

Did he create all of these as well?"

- Kapil Gupta
"If the Thing that created Him allowed him to create the
business, does the money that arose from this business belong
to Him? Or to the Thing that created Him?"

- Kapil Gupta
"A man with the appropriate DNA will be willing to entertain the possibility that his money is not His at all.

He will be willing to entertain the possibility that, in all sincerity and truth, this money belongs to the Thing that created him.

And it is this Thing that is the rightful owner of all that he has created."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man is conditioned.

Where there is conditioning, there cannot be perfect knowledge."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man brings many conditions.

Where there are conditions, there cannot be perfect knowledge."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man is impure.

Where there is impurity, there cannot be perfect knowledge."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man believes that thinking, reasoning, reading, and talking to others will bring him knowledge.

He is correct.

But the knowledge that he receives from such things keeps him ignorant."

- Kapil Gupta
"If, for instance, he has a momentary thought about setting off on a Journey all by himself to find the true knowledge about his domain, he immediately dismisses it as whimsical."

- Kapil Gupta
"For he is conditioned by the belief that “One cannot do it alone."

- Kapil Gupta
"This conditioning is supported by another layer of conditioning which says, “How arrogant and egotistical I am to not listen to the words of others.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"This is supported by yet another layer of conditioning which says, “It is wrong to be egoistic. So whatever I do, I must make certain to be humble and entertain the words of others.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"But the majority, if not the totality, of doing these things is the result of:

1. Having succumbed to the fear of being egoistic.

2. Having succumbed to the belief that one cannot go it alone.

3. Chasing the pleasure-high of the validation that comes with hobnobbing with the intellectuals

4. Putting more “knowledge feathers” into his cap so that he may place them on display in social circles."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a man’s bank account was seized,his family was held hostage until he spoke The Truth,the man would be forced to admit the following

“Okay,I will be honest.Of what use is it to have all of this knowledge if I can’t show it off?

What’s the point of reading a thousand books if I can’t tell others how much I’ve learned?

Don’t you understand that I have an image to maintain?

What if I’m on a podcast and they ask me about something and I don’t know the answer?

What will everyone think of me?”
"Man’s motivations are impure. And it would be a mistake to view this as right or wrong or good or bad. It is simply a non-judgmental and unemotional fact."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man’s motivations are the result of his conditionings."

- Kapil Gupta
"In order to arrive at Perfect Knowledge, one must prepare himself to receive it."

- Kapil Gupta
"The one who is prepared to receive perfect knowledge is the one who longs for it."

- Kapil Gupta
"The one who is prepared to receive perfect knowledge is the one who sets off on a devoted Journey to discover it."

- Kapil Gupta
"In order to understand this, one must understand that the journey of almost all men is not a Journey toward Truth. 

It is a Journey of aversions."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is a Journey away from the fear of ridicule.

It is a Journey of aversions."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is a Journey away from being branded as egoistic.

It is a Journey of aversions."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is a Journey toward being thought of as compassionate.

It is a Journey of aversions."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is a Journey toward being thought of as highly intelligent.

It is a Journey of aversions."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is a Journey through a field of land mines.

It is a Journey of aversions."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is a Journey through a maze of innumerable self conflicts."

It is a Journey of aversions."

- Kapil Gupta
"In truth, Perfect Knowledge was never what he was seeking to begin with."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perfect knowledge is a natural result of Purity."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perfect knowledge is possible only when there are no conditions."

- Kapil Gupta
"When there is neither the need to adorn the ego, nor the fear of being branded an egoist, perfect knowledge becomes possible."

- Kapil Gupta
"When there is neither the need for praise, nor the aversion to scorn, perfect knowledge becomes possible."

- Kapil Gupta
"When there is neither the need to belong to a VIP group, nor the reactive impulse to shun it, perfect knowledge becomes possible."

- Kapil Gupta
"When there is neither the need to chase pleasure, nor the intention to deny oneself of it, perfect knowledge becomes possible."

- Kapil Gupta
"When the pursuit of perfect knowledge arises from a need to know things just as they are, so that one many Arrive, never for the rest of his life having to chase anything or put on heirs of any kind, perfect knowledge becomes possible."

- Kapil Gupta
"All things lead back to Sincerity.

Without the slightest compulsion to “be sincere.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Where there are rules, there can only be lies."

- Kapil Gupta
"Where there are conditions, there can only be circular and self-fulfilling dogmas."

- Kapil Gupta
"The perfect human is the one who is devoted to, and moved by, a Pure motivation To Know. Such a sincerity will blossom over time, destroying all impurities that enter its path."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man cannot “work” his way toward perfection."

- Kapil Gupta
"He cannot “behavior change” his way to perfection."

- Kapil Gupta
"He cannot “book read” his way to perfection."

- Kapil Gupta
"He cannot “mental model” his way to perfection."

- Kapil Gupta
"He cannot “prescription-follow” his way to perfection."

- Kapil Gupta
"He cannot “meditate” his way to perfection."

- Kapil Gupta
"He cannot “mindfulness” his way to perfection."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perfection lies in the freedom from all concepts."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perfection lies in the freedom from all should’s and should not’s."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perfection lies in the freedom from the enslavement to a self-image."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perfection lies in in the pursuit of an Arrival."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perfection lies in the pursuit of Permanence."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perfection lies in the end of all Chases."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perfect Knowledge lies in the Question that no one has thought to ask."

- Kapil Gupta
"And so long as a man is enslaved to his need for validation, he will be limited to finding answers to the ones being asked."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perfect Knowledge lies in the pure desire To Know.

Rather than in the desire to be seen as the one who knows."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one seeks to become a Superstar, or a High Earner on the PGA Tour, he will need to stop playing games."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will need to understand some iron clad, nonnegotiable Truths about the Mind.

He will need to become Serious.

He will need to fall in love with the idea that there is a way to Predict and Orchestrate his results, rather than rely upon chance."

- Kapil Gupta
"What human beings seek above all else is Engagement.

They seek to be Lost in their craft."

- Kapil Gupta
"He might make or miss the cut.

If he makes the cut, he doesn’t know how high he will finish.

If he has a “good week,” he doesn’t know if he’s going to win."

"I’ll end with a comment I received from one of the tour players here at Quail Hollow yesterday:

“Nothing new here, Kapil. Same old . . .”"

"Any man can build a kingdom.

But rare is the man who does not suffer under its weight."

- Kapil Gupta
"Any man can become a success.

But rare is the man who does not become imprisoned by it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Any man can achieve fame.

But rare is the man who remains free of the persona."

- Kapil Gupta
"The desire for success is reactive.

It is borne of a hole one seeks to fill.

It is the same with all desires."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man tends to run from himself, in search of a new world that will camouflage the pain of his past"

- Kapil Gupta
"They exist in order to create a new image, or replace an old one."

"He does not seek a thing for its own sake.

He seeks a thing for what it represents."

- Kapil Gupta
"If he seeks a trophy, it is so that he may view himself as a “winner.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"If he seeks wealth, it is so that he can remove the shame of poverty"

- Kapil Gupta
"He does not seek rewards.

He seeks emblems"

- Kapil Gupta
"He seeks flags that he can plant in new soil, blazoned with his likeness"

- Kapil Gupta
"The insecurities of his past and the inadequacies of his present lead to an uncertainty about his future.

This compels him to want to “be somebody.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"“Becoming” is an imprisoning process.

And an agonizing endeavor.

The reason for this is creation and learning are natural.

“Becoming” is unnatural."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is attempting to change the belief of being something small, into a belief of being something big."

- Kapil Gupta
"The world is not something to be changed. The world will always be the world."

- Kapil Gupta
"The man who desires to create an empire with Truth and Wisdom, will mine his depths in order to come face to face with his demons."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will be intent upon witnessing the inner workings of a mind clogged with impurity and pandemonium."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will insist upon witnessing the subtle undercurrents that flow through his innermost being."

- Kapil Gupta
"The reason he will do this is because he understands that self-sabotage is around every corner. And that this is its source."

- Kapil Gupta
"The reason he will do this is because he understands that his thoughts, words, and actions arise from an instinct that has been polluted by the beliefs he has accumulated from society. And unless these are seen for what they are, they will sink his ship."

- Kapil Gupta
"The reason he will do this is because he understands that a human being is a complex maze of desires and motivations. And unless these are seen in their full complexity, they will create the bars of his prison cell."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will begin to understand that any and all advice is of no use to him. For it is borne of intellect. Intellect is borne of society. Society is full of should’s and should not’s. Should’s and should not’s are borne of a decree to adhere to manufactured societal doctrines."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will understand that anything and everything that he hears is utterly false. Unless he feels it in his bones."

- Kapil Gupta
"Such a man cannot afford the binding chains of “good” or “bad.”

He cannot afford the imprisoning tethers of “right” and “wrong.”

For he will guided by a purity that is beyond the false tenets of “morality.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Because he is at peace, he cannot do wrong to another.

Because he is free, he has no destructive habits.

What needs to be done, he does.

Without a second thought."

- Kapil Gupta
"If the entirety of the workforce needs to be fired because they are not contributing to the vision, he fires them that very afternoon."

- Kapil Gupta
"His heart never skips a beat."

- Kapil Gupta
"He knows nothing of evil or kindness."

- Kapil Gupta
"Whatever action needs to be taken, he does it. And he does it purely."

- Kapil Gupta
"Some of his actions will be viewed by the world as unkind.

Some of his actions will be viewed by the world as benevolent.

But such labels do not exist for him."

- Kapil Gupta
"For he has arrived at Dispassion.

The ultimate state of a human being.

Within him the winds have died.

It is serenity and calm in all directions."

- Kapil Gupta
"The pursuit of building his empire is fundamentally a pursuit of self-transformation."

- Kapil Gupta
"But arrived at a place within himself that, having built an empire, he does not feel attached to it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Arrived at a place within himself that, having built an empire, he is not imprisoned by the Egoic Ownership of it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Arrived at a place in which he is free of his own creation."

- Kapil Gupta
"For if a man is free of his own sense of creation, he becomes a God."

- Kapil Gupta
"And the greatest quality of a God, is his Invisibility."

- Kapil Gupta
"Become silent.

Listen.

Just listen."

- Kapil Gupta
"The sound of wind.

The sound of the air conditioner.

A tinny, high-pitched sound in your ears.

An airplane flying overhead.

The literal ticking of a clock.

All of this is space.

All of this is time."

- Kapil Gupta
"Time waiting to be used.

It sits heavy in the air."

- Kapil Gupta
"Feel the space around you. Rub it in your fingers.

Feel the air that enters your nostrils. It is slightly cool.

This time is an urgent opportunity. It is waiting to be utilized.

It is waiting for you to do something with it."

- Kapil Gupta
"You have never felt this space between your fingers.

You have never experienced the heaviness of it.

You have never experienced the visceral reality of its existence. As you would a piece of furniture in the room."

- Kapil Gupta
"There are moments when you are locked-in. You are driven
and focused.

And in these moments you feel Alive.

But these moments are few.

They are rare."

- Kapil Gupta
"The bulk of your daily existence is spent Not feeling alive.

And growing restless on account."

- Kapil Gupta
"You have tried to find treatments for your restlessness.

But no one has told you why you are restless.

No one has told you that the reason that you are restless is because you have fallen out of the Exalted State of Creativity."

- Kapil Gupta
"A man believes that sometimes he lives in exaltation, and other times he does not.

But he is mistaken."

- Kapil Gupta
"For he does not realize that when he is in Exaltation, he is Alive.

And when he is not, he is Dead."

- Kapil Gupta
"The dead are always restless.

Death is a petri-dish where vermin collect, and diseases grow."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you seek evidence for this, simply examine the deer that races through the snow, its eyes gleaming, its skin perfect and pure.

Then examine the one that lies on the side of the road, being picked apart by vultures and maggots.

Do you see?

Exaltation is Life.

Domesticity is Death"

- Kapil Gupta
"Exaltation is Life.

Domesticity is Death."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why is it so rare for man to find himself in exaltation?

2. Because of the environment that resides within him."

- Kapil Gupta
"I don't believe in optimism"

- Kapil Gupta
"I'm not looking forward to anything"

- Kapil Gupta
"I do not want tomorrow to bring me something"

- Kapil Gupta
"Why you started it in the first place?"

- Kapil Gupta
"What's the thing that you truly want to achieve?"

- Kapil Gupta
"What's your arrival?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Love is attachment"

- Kapil Gupta
"We find a man who sees the world his way. He does for his wife. He does for his children.

Also, he needs from his wife. He needs from his children."

- Kapil Gupta
"The wife does for her husband. And she does for her children.

Also, she needs from her husband. She needs from her children."

- Kapil Gupta
"Where there is a group of individuals who are resigned to the idea of “me,” there cannot be a family."

- Kapil Gupta
"Four, five, or twelve “me’s” cannot make a family. One may certainly “refer to” such an entity as a “family,” but it would be in name only."

- Kapil Gupta
"I am Not speaking of ideas such as:

Altruism
Kindness
Selflessness (in the traditional sense)
Compassion
There is no “I” in team
Sacrificing oneself for the whole

These are all false and reactive societal constructs.

They do not exist"

- Kapil Gupta
"There can only be a group of individuals who strategically modify their words and actions in order to keep the family solvent."

- Kapil Gupta
"There can only be a group of individuals who “try to do what is right.”

As such, it will be a lifelong series of “efforts.”

A lifelong series of “ups and downs.”

A lifelong series of “struggles.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Nature never “efforts.”

Nature never has “ups and downs.”

Nature never has “struggles.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"If something is all a human has ever known, he has no choice but to somehow justify it."

- Kapil Gupta
"For if he has no alternative to offer, he will live forever in a state of angst."

- Kapil Gupta
"As it turns out, man lives forever in a state of angst, regardless. 

But at least he has tried to mentally organize it in a patchwork that he can accept."

- Kapil Gupta
"Where there is a set of ego’s (in the form of “me’s”), there cannot be a family."

- Kapil Gupta
"No matter how much a person may “love” the other, he will infinitely and always, deep within his heart of hearts, prioritize this “me” over any other me."

- Kapil Gupta
"Most parents would not only “risk” their life, but would gladly Give their life for their child. 

But the reason they would do so is not just because of the child. But because the child belongs to Him or Her."

- Kapil Gupta
"The child belongs to the parent’s sense of “me and mine.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Because where there are a group of “me’s,” there is no deep-seated communion."

- Kapil Gupta
"I am not speaking of “altruism.”

For “altruism” is a “me” who tries to “self-sacrifice” for another.

It is a “me” who is engaging in a “holy” act."

- Kapil Gupta
"A family is a group of humans who cannot but for the life of them, think of themselves. 

When they look into the mirror, they see the others."

- Kapil Gupta
"Outside of the family environment, they may become
personally driven and ambitious “me’s” if they wish.

But within the family, they have no sense of “self.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Please understand that I will not so disrespect the reader as to “preach” to him. 

I will not so disrespect the reader as to perform what I call a “drive-by,” by telling him to “become egoless” and ride off into the night."

- Kapil Gupta
"Firstly, the very idea of becoming “egoless” is saturated with ego.

For it is an act of replacing a self-identity of one with ego, to one without ego."

- Kapil Gupta
"The real doing is a non-doing"

- Kapil Gupta
"The ultimate action is understanding."

- Kapil Gupta
"Seeing is more doing than any possible doing you can do"

- Kapil Gupta
"Unless a human being required to do something, he won't."

- Kapil Gupta
"No human being acts unless there's a consequence"

- Kapil Gupta
"The vast majority of time that the word "love" is used it is actually describing attachment."

- Kapil Gupta
"The self is a moving target."

- Kapil Gupta
"The mind is like the weather"

- Kapil Gupta
"What is it that i have never really understood about you?"

(to your child)
- Kapil Gupta
"A person says, “I don’t care what they think of me.”

This is a reaction against an ego that cannot bear the fact that it is indeed affected by what others think of it"

- Kapil Gupta
"A person says, “I will do exactly as I please, no matter what anyone says.”

This is a reaction against a fear of being controlled by the opinions of others."

- Kapil Gupta
"Who is the one that is truly immune to what others think?

The one who acts in silence.

And makes not a single reactive statement."

- Kapil Gupta
"Then what is the genuine characteristic of one who truly has become immune to what others think?

The thought of what others may think does not even arise in his mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"I do not subscribe to any ideas put forth by society. If it does not exist in nature, for me it does not exist at all."

- Kapil Gupta
"What, fundamentally, is “cold” and “narcissistic” and “good” and “compassionate” and “sociopathic?”

These are all reactions.

They are reactions against a fear of their opposite."

- Kapil Gupta
"These are all reactions."

- Kapil Gupta
"A man fears being called a “narcissist,” so he becomes an “empath.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"A man fears being called a “pushover,” so he becomes a “disciplinarian.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"A “disciplinarian” fears being called “cold,” so he tries to become “compassionate.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"A society that has strayed so far from nature, there is no way back."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why is it that man seeks validation from others?

Because he is not content with who he is.

He has holes that need to be filled. He has wounds that need attention."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why is he not content with who he is?"

- Kapil Gupta
"How can he love himself if he does not know what love truly is?"

- Kapil Gupta
"How can he be happy with a self that he does not truly understand?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is the dirty little secret that the world will never tell you. For it does not fit its flowery narrative."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is that it is impossible for man to be content with who he is."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why is it impossible for man to be content with who he is?

Because the things that man believes himself to be are lights and shadows."

- Kapil Gupta
"One may be able to stand for a moment upon shifting sand, but it is impossible for him to build a home upon it."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a man is asked to describe himself, he might say, “I am the founder of Company X. I am 32 years old. I am 6 feet tall. I enjoy hiking, climbing, and running. I have a lovely wife and three children, ages 6, 9, and 12. I am a compassionate person, but of course I have my flaws. I get too angry sometimes. This is one of my great flaws. But I am heavily into self-improvement. I love to read books, and talk with friends. I have many strong qualities . . . ”"

- Kapil Gupta
"What did this man say that is Not shifting sand?

What did he say that is firm and foundational enough to support a permanent home?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Company X could go bankrupt. One small scandal, one bad business deal, one off-handed comment in the media, and the company could be gone. He knows this. And thus, he lives in fear

Shifting sand."

- Kapil Gupta
"He is 32 years old, and 6 feet tall. This “32” will one day become “72.” And as his bones become brittle, and his spine becomes to bend with old age, the “6 feet’ will one day become “5 foot 9.”

Shifting sand."

- Kapil Gupta
"His wife may be with him forever. But if she is, there will likely be endless conflicts, subtle or grand. Or they may get a divorce.

Shifting sand."

- Kapil Gupta
"His children will soon become adults. And they will leave their father’s house forever.

Shifting sand"

- Kapil Gupta
"His anger is something he is “working on” through “self improvement.” This is a prescription. He will follow such prescriptions forever and gain a sense of false security for having gotten a little bit better at anger, in certain circumstances. And his compassion is a reaction to his guilt for the anger.

Shifting sand."

- Kapil Gupta
"All of man’s ideas, thoughts, and beliefs about who he is are an attempt to hold onto shifting sand.

There is nothing Solid to be found."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because there is nothing solid there, he can he possibly become “content?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"How can one become content in something that is poorly understood, and constantly changing?"

- Kapil Gupta
"There is no solid ground.

And where there is no solid ground, there is no possibility of contentment.

There is only one subtle fracture attached to another."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a man truly seeks to become immune to what others think of him, he will have to be willing to drop the nonsense."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will have to be willing to see that it is his very own fragmented nature that compels him to turn toward others."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will have to be willing to see that whatever “others” may give him will soon wash away with the shifting sands."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will have to be willing to see that it is only once he becomes Whole within himself that he will no longer need anything from anyone else."

- Kapil Gupta
"And he will have to be willing to see that in order to become Whole within himself . . ."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will have to go on a Journey to see through all the things that he is Not, but has for the whole of his life believed himself to be."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man was created to be a universe unto himself.

But he becomes the Universe, only once he recognizes . . .

That he is not a “self” at all."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why is the tree still?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The tree is still because it has no concept of itself."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why does the tree have no concept of itself?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Why does the tree have no concept of itself?

Because the tree has no mind.

A human being has a mind.

And because he has a mind, he has a self-concept. 

He has a self-image."

- Kapil Gupta
"Where there is a self-concept, there is a strong desire to preserve it. And an instinctive need to protect it from harm."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man spends his life in a desperate attempt to keep the sandy shores from becoming drenched by the incoming tides."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Mind can do anything it wishes to the man it possesses.

Anything.

Whenever it likes, it can tease him, assault him, soothe him, control him, enrage him, or make him anxious, worried, and afraid."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man believes that he is in control of his life. That he is the one who makes his decisions.

How preposterous."

- Kapil Gupta
"A man who is fighting with his spouse.

She accuses him of being lazy and inconsiderate. 

The man’s mind will scour his past in order to find evidence to the contrary.It will illustrate times when he was not at all lazy, and most considerate.

The mind of the spouse will find examples of the times when he has been lazy and inconsiderate."

- Kapil Gupta
"But with each repeated episode of conflict, something fundamental within each of them will have changed.

This conflict will create fear and anxiety within each of the minds. A fear that it might happen again."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why will they fear that it might happen again?

Because man fears displeasure. He fears pain. He fears discomfort of any kind."

- Kapil Gupta
"Each of these two individuals will begin to grow averse to one another. The word choices, the body language, the truths that are kept to themselves, and hundreds of small things will all be done in an effort to avoid conflict

And an effort to avoid the pain that is associated with this conflict.

Over time, the relationship will harden. It will become brittle. And die."

- Kapil Gupta
"For it is a relationship of aversion. It is a relationship of avoidance.

Not necessarily an avoidance of each other. But an avoidance of being natural and free, borne of the fear and anxiety of the pain of potential conflict."

- Kapil Gupta
"What a man does not have, the mind creates fear and anxiety of not receiving."

- Kapil Gupta
"What a man does have, the mind creates fear and anxiety of losing."

- Kapil Gupta
"Then man tries to be clever."

- Kapil Gupta
"He searches for a way to “treat” this anxiety and fear."

- Kapil Gupta
"He searches for a way to “treat” this anxiety and fear.

Industrious by nature, he delves into mediation, mindfulness, pills, workshops, and various methods and techniques in order to lessen the effects of this anxiety and fear.

But these are but ointments on a wound that extends into the depths of his core.

Such wounds cannot be “treated.”

And because they cannot be treated, man leaves this world never having lived a life free of anxiety and fear."

- Kapil Gupta
"Whatever he may have succeeded at . . .

Whatever he may have attained in this world . . .

He will have failed at the most fundamental aspect of his life."

- Kapil Gupta
"Is there a way out?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Is there truly a cure to fear and anxiety?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Can a man, in his current life, truly and practically attain what few have ever attained in the history of human civilization?"

- Kapil Gupta
"No matter how closely you may be reading these words, your mind is reading them closer.

It is interpreting them for you, making modifications as it sees fit. An omission here, an addition there. And presenting its own version of them to you.

And because you have such reverence for your mind, you will accept the interpretation as gospel. No questions asked."

- Kapil Gupta
"No matter how closely you may be reading
these words, your mind is reading them closer."

- Kapil Gupta
In many ways, it is almost pointless for me to write these discourses.

I write them as a reminder to my own mind. As I finalize the process of dismantling it altogether. In order to live permanently within the freedom that is the fundamental birthright afforded to all human beings.
"I will tell you the way out.

But, I will be frank. It will likely do nothing for you.

Because the mind will receive it as a prescription.

It will make you “try to do” what I have said. 

And in keeping you busy in this way, you will never arrive.

This is how ingenious this mind of yours is."

- Kapil Gupta
"How is it that man can live a life completely free of anxiety and fear?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Why is it that a tree is so naturally still? (The key word is Naturally. For I assure you the tree is not forcing itself to be still through “meditation”)."

- Kapil Gupta
"The tree is still because it is free. It is free from all anxieties and all fears."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why is the tree free?

Because the tree has no concept of itself."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why is the tree free?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The Mind will now tell you, “You see? You too must have no concept of yourself.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The Mind will now tell you, “You see? You too must have no concept of yourself.”

And in so doing, it will have opened up a new
corridor of anxiety. For soon after you begin, you will become beset by anxiety for not being able to lose your concept of yourself."

- Kapil Gupta
"I will happily give you the secrets of the universe. But if you imbibe them as a prescription, they will create nothing but problems for you."

- Kapil Gupta
"The key to all things is the pursuit of Visceral Understanding."

- Kapil Gupta
"But man has been taught to “think.” And he has become prideful in this very ability.

It is for this reason that he cannot experience Truth."
- Kapil Gupta
"For Truth lies beyond the domain of thought.

And beyond the outer reaches of the Mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"The man who becomes a legend is the man who arrives at the perfect questions."

- Kapil Gupta
"Answers have the effect of keeping one where he is."

- Kapil Gupta
Questions have the effect of catapulting one to higher states.
"The man of limited success will seek improvement, incremental progress, and competition."

- Kapil Gupta
"He may achieve periods of success in this struggle. But the success will be limited. And the struggle, unlimited."

- Kapil Gupta
"He may achieve periods of success in this struggle. But the success will be limited. And the struggle, unlimited.

This is where the bulk of humanity lives. Even in the professional ranks."

- Kapil Gupta
"Professional athletes strike their head against a wall, and the one who remains conscious at the end, “wins.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The man who becomes a Legend is the man who sees beyond things such as improvement, progress, and competition."
 
- Kapil Gupta
"The Legend does not ask, “How is it that I can improve?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The Legend asks, “What is my ultimate capability as a human organism? What is the glory that nature has bestowed me with?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The Legend does not ask, “How is it that I can improve?”

The Legend asks, “What is my ultimate capability as a human organism? What is the glory that nature has bestowed me with?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The common man is afraid of “losing.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The Legend is afraid of not arriving at his ultimate capability"

- Kapil Gupta
"The common man is afraid of “losing.”

The Legend is afraid of not arriving at his ultimate capability."

- Kapil Gupta
"One may choose to believe this or not, but one cannot “practice” his way to becoming a Legend."

- Kapil Gupta
"And for those who say they have, what they have not recognized is what they could have been had they walked a different path."

- Kapil Gupta
"In my work with human beings, I make it clear from the outset that I have not taken them on in order to make them “better.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"My attention is not affixed on their level of
“improvement.” 

It is affixed upon their ultimate capability as a human being. 

As it turns out, this approach has allowed me to help individuals achieve otherworldly success in a fraction of the time."

- Kapil Gupta
"Becoming a Legend has become more difficult than ever.

Because the time in which we are living belongs to what I call the “distracted generation.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"If a man lived in a jungle, without the luxurious distractions of the modern world, he would have a much easier time becoming a Legend."

- Kapil Gupta
In order to become a legend, one must have a certain DNA. 

Not a genetic DNA. But a sensibility DNA. A personality DNA.
"A DNA that is ready and willing to fully imbibe the fact that everything he has learned from the world has been scandalously wrong.

A DNA that is sympathetic to the fact that technique is a prison.

A DNA that has the capacity to embrace the fact that competition leads only to limitation.

A DNA that is willing to understand that it is only in becoming a Master, that one becomes a legend."

- Kapil Gupta
"A man who is outraged by truths that lie miles beyond the picket fences of tradition, convention, and prevailing “expert” dogma has no chance of becoming a legend."

- Kapil Gupta
"Such human beings are not ones that I seek to “convert” or “convince.” They are human beings for whom I have no time or regard. And if such a human beings has Accidentally found his way to my work, it will be best for us both if he leaves immediately. "

- Kapil Gupta
"Never to return again.

My time is limited on this earth.

I cannot afford to waste a single minute."

- Kapil Gupta
"Becoming a legend is about Becoming Serious.

Not serious enough to “do the work.” But Serious enough to explore The Truth.

Serious enough to abandon all hope.

Serious enough to abandon all striving.

Serious enough to arrive before one arrives."

- Kapil Gupta
"Becoming a legend is about Becoming Serious."

- Kapil Gupta
"Not serious enough to “do the work.” But Serious enough to explore The Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"Serious enough to abandon all hope."

- Kapil Gupta
"Serious enough to abandon all striving."

- Kapil Gupta
"Serious enough to arrive before one arrives."

- Kapil Gupta
"A legend becomes a legend Before he becomes a legend."

- Kapil Gupta
"All things happen Before they happen."

- Kapil Gupta
"Only the one whose Seriousness has matured, has created an internal environment that spawns True Questions."

- Kapil Gupta
"Allow these words to seep into your bones, rather than relegating them to the “collection area” known as the Intellect"

- Kapil Gupta
"Greatness arises from the Viscera.

Not from the brain or the lips."

- Kapil Gupta
"The fact is that almost all men, women, and children on this earth will inescapably succumb to the distractions of their lives.

There are but a few who will have the DNA to overcome the momentum of society’s conditioning.

These individuals alone, are candidates for becoming Legends."

- Kapil Gupta
"Those who are unsuccessful . . . COULD BE Successful.

Those who are successful . . . COULD BE Great.

Those who are great . . . COULD BE Legends.

They are all missing a Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man is not comfortable unless he invents struggles."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a man is working toward a lofty goal, if he is told that it is clear sailing, that nothing is in his way, and all hurdles have been removed . . ."

- Kapil Gupta
"It must first be understood that man is not a sane human being."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man has absolutely no cognition or recognition of this fact, but it is precisely the place from which he functions."

- Kapil Gupta
"“Listen, there has to be some form of struggle. No one gets anywhere without hard work and toil and years and years of pain, failure, disappointment, and struggle. Nothing is smooth sailing. And even if you were to clear the way for me, I just cannot accept this. It isn’t right. It’s just plain wrong. Struggle, sweat, hard work, and grinding has to be there. Or nlarge scale achievements cannot be had.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"I will not abandon you as all the others have done, by leaving you with a drive-by sort of philosophy and letting you fend for yourself."

- Kapil Gupta
"A healthy portion of the thousands of minds that are reading this are hoping for something. They are hoping that I will make at least a token concession that “hard work” is needed. For only then will they be able to take me seriously."

- Kapil Gupta
"Only then will they be able to breathe a sigh of relief that I am “one of them.” And now that I am one of them, they can now allow themselves to listen."

- Kapil Gupta
"I take no stance on things.

For if I take a stance on something, I will be forced to “defend” my position.

And this act of defending my position will take me away from the Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"I take no stance on things."

- Kapil Gupta
"For if I take a stance on something, I will be forced to “defend” my position."

- Kapil Gupta
"My allegiance is never to any man, group, or philosophy."

- Kapil Gupta
"My allegiance is never to any man, group, or philosophy.

And it certainly isn’t to “myself.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Man believes in “working his way up.”

This is manufactured struggle.

This is inventing extra rungs on the ladder . . .

This is inventing hurdles on the track . . .

This is inventing a headwind on a calm and sunny day . . ."

- Kapil Gupta
"Of all the struggles that any human being, successful or unsuccessful, has had to face, the overwhelming majority of them are Invented."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man has a habit of making small things seem big. In order to give himself the feeling of conquest for a win, or the feeling of resilience for a loss."

- Kapil Gupta
"An athlete who seeks to become a professional looks at the “traditional path” of getting there. When there are paths that he may have never looked sufficiently outside the box to consider. And if he dares to take the first step toward this path, a siren sounds. The world of people, friends, parents, coaches, teachers, media drop everything and run toward him. They line the sidewalk by the thousands and spout their traditional and predictable nonsense."

- Kapil Gupta
"The teacher says, “Make sure you get your education first.”

The parent says, “Make sure you have a backup plan in case you don’t make it.”

The coach says, “It’s a hard road. Less than 1 percent make it. Give it a try, but you don’t know how good those pros really are.”

The media says, “He doesn’t have the size, the strength, or the pedigree for it.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Firstly, they likely never had the courage to dream big. So they settled for a traditional life of struggle and making ends meet.

Secondly, even if they did have the courage to dream big, they became victims of these very same people. And they failed because of it."

- Kapil Gupta
"How can a man possibly allow himself to believe that “someone else” is going to make it, when “he himself” did not?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Their invented struggles ruined them."

- Kapil Gupta
"The one who succeeds also invents struggles. It is just that either he has not invented quite as many, or he simultaneously developed a self-image of resilience in order to overcome his invented struggles."

- Kapil Gupta
"What is the Path to becoming successful, or great, or a legend?

The Path is to first become Sincere."

"Discover for yourself if you truly wish to know The Truth?"

- Kapil Gupta
"If you do, then explore which of your struggles are TRULY nnatural. Discover which struggles are flames that you Truly do not fan.

And then examine which struggles you have Invented. Without the slightest bit of self-blame or condemnation.

For if you condemn yourself, you will create more excuses. And thus, more struggles"

- Kapil Gupta
"Discover which of the struggles you were Conditioned By Society to create."

- Kapil Gupta
"If society and the people around you support and and endorse the struggle, you can be assured that it is invented."

- Kapil Gupta
"There are many other Truths that involve recesses of your Mind that the world simply hasn’t come to know."

- Kapil Gupta
"There are places within your Mind that, if they are so much as recognized, you will have no choice but to leap into a new level of being."

- Kapil Gupta
"But, for now, I will leave you to examine your invented struggles.

So that you may begin to see just how readily within your grasp it is . . .

To become a Legend in your field."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is that if one relies upon thought to make a decision, his decision will be imperfect."

- Kapil Gupta
"What does it mean to say that an imperfect decision will be the product of hope and fear?"

- Kapil Gupta
"It means that the decision will be made in search of one thing, while trying to avoid another thing. It will be reactive. It will be based upon pleasure on onehand, and aversion on the other.

Such a decision is imperfect.

It cannot be based upon the True course of action."

- Kapil Gupta
"If thinking is employed to make a decision, the mind will create an impure decision."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one does not “think,” from where will the decision arise?"

- Kapil Gupta
"If one seeks a Pure decision . . .

If one seeks a Perfect decision . . .

He will Not do as the world prescribes: mental models, techniques, hacks, and methods. For such things do not create perfect decisions."

- Kapil Gupta
"They create intellectual decisions.

Intellectual decisions are created by the mind.

And the mind is full of impurities of the ego. Of hope, fear, gain, loss, aversion, and so on."

- Kapil Gupta
"The way to arrive at a Perfect decision is not through “mental models.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The way to arrive at a Perfect decision is not by way of “deliberation.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The way to arrive at a Perfect decision is not by putting on one’s “thinking cap.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The way to arrive at a Perfect decision is by turning Off thinking."

- Kapil Gupta
"One will wonder how a perfect decision can possibly arise if he turns off the very mechanism that is believed to give birth to decisions."

- Kapil Gupta
"When thinking is turned off, interference is turned off."

- Kapil Gupta
"When thinking is turned off, the mind is turned off."

- Kapil Gupta
"When the mind is turned off, hope and fear and all impurities are turned off."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is precisely this place of quiet and purity that is ready to receive a Pure and Perfect Decision."

- Kapil Gupta
"This perfect decision may arise as a feeling.

And it may even arise As a thought.

But it does not arise FROM thought."

- Kapil Gupta
"And when the perfect decision arises, as if out of nowhere, the person may or may not be able to explain why . . .

But deep in his bones, by way of an insight he cannot quite articulate, he Knows it is the Truth.

And this Truth . . . is Perfect."

"What Do I Mean By Stress?

Fear, anxiety, depression, emotional pain, anger, nervousness, mood swings, and so on.

Anything that robs you of Peace."

- Kapil Gupta
"Where Do We Begin?

That which is false begins with Addition.

That which is Truth begins with Subtraction.

Let us first Subtract the false and/or irrelevant ideas that have been drilled into your head."

- Kapil Gupta
"How depression is divided into chemical depression versus behavioral depression.

All things are physiologic. If someone tells you something funny and you laugh, that is physiologic."

- Kapil Gupta
"The behavior Stems From the physiology."

- Kapil Gupta
"Something is not made serious or bona fide on the count of its being deemed “chemical” or “physiologic.”

It is Serious because it robs you of the Experience Of Life.

It is Serious because it robs you of a beautiful relationship with your spouse and your children."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a man is an alcoholic, or has a problem with substance abuse, no serious-minded person would believe that a tip or a technique would cure him."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man will seek any outlet and will grasp at any straw in order to experience even a moment’s respite from the pain."

"Why would any human being want to “manage” cancer?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The only reason that he wouldn’t look for a Cure is if the doctors and the society told him that a cure was impossible. And quite frankly, Even Then, there would be that One Serious Human Being who would say, “To hell with all of you. I will comb the edges of the Earth. I will travel to holistic healers and shamans. I will do anything I have to do to find a Cure for my cancer.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"I Do Not Know The Journey Until I Speak To Someone"

- Kapil Gupta
"A man once asked The Buddha, “Sir, is there a God?”

The Buddha replied, “No.”

Another man asked The Buddha, “Sir, is there a God?”

The Buddha replied, “Yes.”"

- Kapil Gupta
" “Venerable Sir, why did you tell one man that there is a God and another man that there is not?”

The Buddha said (paraphrase), “I gave each man the knowledge that was best suited for his journey.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Do you remember in the days before GPS, you would call the store and ask for directions? And the very first thing that the person on the other line would ask you is, “Where are you coming from?” The store keeper could not possibly give the same directions to everyone. For each person would be coming from a different side of town."

- Kapil Gupta
"Another reason that I cannot tell you your journey without speaking with you is this: For Me, Every Human Being Is Their Own Unique Universe."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have never brought a briefcase to any meeting with one of my clients.

I have never brought a power point presentation.

Or a “five-point plan.”

Or a predetermined agenda.

Or, believe it or not, any idea whatsoever of what I am going to say.

If I give a talk, I do not Prepare a speech."

- Kapil Gupta
"If I give a talk, I do not Prepare a speech."

- Kapil Gupta
"Before I give a talk, or before I speak with a client on the phone or in person, whether it is the First time we are speaking or the 20th time we are speaking, I have trained myself to rid myself of all involuntary thoughts. So that I can remove all interference and become One Hundred Percent Available."

- Kapil Gupta
"But in becoming One Hundred Percent Available, something quite miraculous happens. You begin to see into the human being. You acquire the ability to predict what he is going to say.

And The Path to transforming him or her Organically begins to materialize.

In essence, you stop listening with your ears, and you begin to listen with your entire body."

- Kapil Gupta
"Similar to the way in which “Brooks” (a character in The Shawshank Redemption) had become so “institutionalized” after 50 years of imprisonment that he favored incarceration over freedom. So much so, in fact, that days after being released, he hung himself."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is this that makes me hesitant to reveal to you some of these Truths.

What I mean is that the words will be read Too Easily. Even That is a very difficult thing to explain. But I will do my best.

Your brain will read the words. And it will know the meaning of each word according to its Dictionary Definition. But when the words are arranged as they are, they will be read Too Easily."

- Kapil Gupta
"Your brain will read the words. And it will know the meaning of each word according to its Dictionary Definition. But when the words are arranged as they are, they will be read Too Easily."

And they will begin to do their magic inside the one who is Ready to receive them. "

- Kapil Gupta
"Remember, The Truth always begins with Subtraction rather than Addition."

- Kapil Gupta
"Subtraction is imperative, because unless one clears the way for The Truth, there will be no space for it to stand."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you truly wish to eradicate stress from your life, you must understand something."

- Kapil Gupta
"Human beings Say that they would like to be
free of their dramas, but they will fight you to the death if you try to take them away from them. For who would they be without them?"

- Kapil Gupta
"One last time:
Prescriptions. Do. Not. Work. 

And what will you find in the world?

Nothing but Prescriptions,

- Kapil Gupta
"Stress management seminars are just that. “Management.” This is like swirling muddy water. For the briefest of moments a portion of the water will be clear. But the very next moment, the muddy water settles again."

"The Ultimate Subtraction is to subtract Everything.

Yes, Everything"

"Nothing that the world tries to sell you works."

- Kapil Gupta
"You don’t have to believe me. Just look in the mirror. Has it worked?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Look at your neighbor. Has it worked?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Look at the millions who continue to attend “stressmanagement” workshops. Has it worked?"

- Kapil Gupta
"If you go to the emergency room with internal bleeding, they don’t simply open you up and fill you with thirty packs of gauze and send you home, do they?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The truth is that the “stressor” is not the source of the bleed. It simply
sets the stage for the bleed to take place. The bleed was bound
to happen at one point or another."

- Kapil Gupta
"One of the central sources of the bleed when it comes to stress is the fact that a human being isn’t yet ready to eradicate stress from his or her life."

- Kapil Gupta
"But he isn’t necessarily Dying to be free of it. He may lay awake at night Stressed. But he doesn’t necessarily lay awake at night Absolutely Craving to never have stress again. He doesn’t fantasize about categorically eliminating all such turmoil from his life."

- Kapil Gupta
"My friend, water boils at 100 degrees. But at 99 it only simmers."

"Finding freedom or peace is something they can outsource to a week-long seminar?"

- Kapil Gupta
"“Well if I don’t work on myself, what’s the alternative? It certainly isn’t going to happen by me doing nothing at all.”

I see your point. But the answer is Yes and No."

- Kapil Gupta
"“Work on yourself” is psychology’s way of telling you to adhere to a certain norm. It is telling you that you are Faulty and that you need to be Fixed."

- Kapil Gupta
"Essentially, it is telling you that you need to be more Correct in the way that you think and act. Because if you do it Correctly, you will begin to feel better.

But you see, this leads us right back to “managing” and “dealing with” cancer."

- Kapil Gupta
"A Cure. A Complete Eradication is what this treatise is aimed at. Not palliative treatment. Not “management.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"What is imperative to understand is that this is not a Fault that needs Fixing."

- Kapil Gupta
"That which you attempt to Fix gets worse."

- Kapil Gupta
"In order for you to transform anything, you must first understand how it is designed. When you attempt to Fix something related to the Mind, it only gets worse."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because your attention moves from the problem to the fix. And soon the Fix becomes the new problem. While at first you were attempting to Fix the problem, soon you will attempt to Fix the Fix. "

- Kapil Gupta
"“Well, if I have the problem, and it doesn’t respond to a Fix, then what do I do?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"What you must do is to first drop all “doings” and “fixes” and come to a Realization."

- Kapil Gupta
"Your stress and turmoil are serving a purpose for you. As strange as it may sound to you, there is something that you are gaining from it."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you look deeply, you will find that your turmoil is serving a need. It has become a part of your Identity. And you are confused by what your life would be like without it."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Ultimate Truth is to Fall in Love.

To Fall In Love With The Idea of Living A Life Free Of Stress and Turmoil."

- Kapil Gupta
"The question is not “How do I get to that vision?”

The question is “What are the things that are standing in the way?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"I simply cannot reveal to you a more honest and sincere Truth than to say that nothing is possible until you are Ready."

- Kapil Gupta
"Are you truly Ready to leave stress behind forever?"

- Kapil Gupta
"This is why many are content with “managing” and “dealing with.” Because that way they don’t have to compromise what has come to be their identity."

- Kapil Gupta
"They are not looking for a whole new life. They are simply looking for a slightly improved version of the current one."

- Kapil Gupta
"I will not try to sell you on the idea of finding Freedom. Or discovering a life of Peace and Equanimity.

Such an idea will attract those who are Ready."

- Kapil Gupta
"When a human being becomes Ready, even the seemingly impossible becomes Possible."

"No Prescriptions.

No tips.

No “ways to deal with” it.

No “what you should do.”

No empathy.

No sympathy.

No “be compassionate.”

No “act your age.”

No “be kind.”

No “take a deep breath.”

No “take five minutes to calm down.”

No “medications.”

No “psychotherapy.”

No “what happened in your childhood.”"

The moment you shake hands with that person, or give them a hug, or even stand in front of them, Their Spirit Immediately Senses That You Are Enlightened."

"Why do you think that throughout the history of India, businessmen donated cars and palaces and millions of dollars to a swami?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Understand this: The people who end up coming to me almost never know that they are One Of A Kinds"

- Kapil Gupta
"Why does man seek pleasure?

Because his life is unsatisfying."

- Kapil Gupta
"He must seek pleasure in order to get a hit. Then another. And another.

And in stringing together these hits, he seeks to create a pleasurable life."

- Kapil Gupta
"I would never tell a human being Not to seek pleasure.

Because if I were to tell him that, he would ask me what he should do instead."

- Kapil Gupta
"Transformation does not arise through habits, rituals, and prescriptions.

It arises through direct Understanding."

- Kapil Gupta
"Even if it makes me feel out of breath. Even if it makes my legs ache with pain and fatigue. Even if it makes me drop to the ground and vomit from overexertion.

Because I know that having reached it, I will be able to rest forever. I will know that having reached it, it will be done. I will have arrived. I will never have to chase again."

- Kapil Gupta
"But to run fast, long, and hard, become overexerted, and have my legs ache and drop to the ground in vomitus for something that is only going to need more chasing is ridiculous."

- Kapil Gupta
"He Believes that this will be the last chase. So it appears to be
worth it.

But each time he arrives, he realizes it was only a mirage.

So he must chase again."

- Kapil Gupta
"Not a single person in his life tells him that what he is chasing is the chase itself.

Not a single person in his life tells him that everything is a mirage.

Not a single person in his life tells him that there is something that he can have without chasing it.

So that he will never have to chase again."

- Kapil Gupta
"It can only sell you a few minutes of escape in the form of meditation, hedonism, alcohol, a massage, or a vacation."

- Kapil Gupta
"It can only sell you a drop or two of happiness."

- Kapil Gupta
"Nothing creates pain like the search for pleasure."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man goes to parties. He laughs to hide his miseries.

He drinks to numb himself from his pains.

On the one hand he chases in order to find something.

On the other hand he drugs himself in order to alleviate the pain of the chase."

- Kapil Gupta
"Personally, one need not wait for hell.

This society is worse than any hell in the afterlife."

- Kapil Gupta
"Something tells me that the devil knows all about pleasure and pain. Perhaps he created pleasure in order to entice people into his world."

- Kapil Gupta
"One of the rarest things in this society is a deep conversation about The Truths of one’s life."

- Kapil Gupta
"A human being is not a personality.

It is not a set of likes and dislikes. For this is Mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"A human being is an organism.

A nameless, identity-less organism.

It has numerous functions which serve to sustain itself.

It feels.

It senses.

It perceives.

But it does not “think.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"“Thinking” is a learned behavior."

- Kapil Gupta
"A human being in its native form Knows without thinking."

"Perfect has nothing to do with Perfectionism"

"Perfect is the state of Being Perfect.

Perfectionism is the Need to be perfect."

"The seasons do not arrive according to a calendar. 

For it is only man that bows to the concept of “time.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Why not make your own life as Perfect as nature?

Are you not a part of nature?

Why does nature live perfect and blissful, and man live in imperfection and turmoil?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Mind you, if you decide to walk this Path, there can be nofailure.

For the very possibility of failure implies that you believe there is the possibility that you were not meant to be Perfect."

- Kapil Gupta
"Mankind has lost the war with his mind. And the greatest reason for this is because he doesn’t even recognize that a battle is taking place."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you try to do something perfectly, it will be imperfect."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you consciously try Not to be perfect, then you will be trapped by the trying Not To, and thus perfection will evade you once again."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you attempt to think a certain way, the mind will create a thought against your thought, and it will win."

"If ISIS targeted our homes and destroyed them ten times over, it would not fractionally compare to the inner turmoil that we have experienced in our lives.

Who needs to worry about “ISIS” when within our minds lives all the “terror” we can possibly handle?"

"If a man became Free of all of the above, then even if ISIS targeted him, he would die having lived in Peace and Freedom."

- Kapil Gupta
"What does the mind love more than a tasty distraction?"

"Man simply looks for a place to belong so that he has something to fight for and fight against."

"Bombardment by rifle shells is simply no match for bombardment by involuntary thoughts!"

- Kapil Gupta
"Devoting our lives to finding Perfection in the way that we live . . .

. . . is far more inspirational than worrying about how we will die."

- Kapil Gupta
"Anxiety is the natural byproduct of living life as Your Manufactured Self."

- Kapil Gupta
"The reason I say “Authentically wish” is because although a significant percentage of the population complains about their dramas, they will fight to the death anyone who tries to take them away from them."

- Kapil Gupta
"For who would they be without their drama?"

- Kapil Gupta
"For your entire life, you have lived as “yourself.”

You might naturally ask, “Who else would I live as?”"

"If you point to your head. That is not “you.” That is your “head.”"

"I can see your arm, your chest, your hand, your face, and your head.

But where is this person called “you?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The secret is that for the rest of your life, you can be a caretaker if you wish. You may adorn this person and beautify her and take her to the highest levels of wealth and success.

None of that is a problem. In fact, it can be quite exhilarating. As long as you are Free while doing it."

"As a result, he has become Permanently Cured of all the anxieties that torment mere mortals on an almost hourly basis."

- Kapil Gupta
"He is able to give to his family (and anyone who comes to see him), precisely what they need when they need it. He knows what to say, how much to give, when to shelter and comfort, when to set loose. And he knows this because he has attained that most elusive of superhuman qualities: Clarity."

- Kapil Gupta
"All of his actions stem from Wisdom. They are bathed in wisdom. They are sheathed in wisdom. It is not that he “practices” it or “attempts to do the right thing.” The Wisdom simply surfaces at the right time. Without him having to do anything at all."

It is as if there is an invisible shield around him that protects him wherever he goes. How does this happen? Very well, I’ll reveal something to you. (psst . . . All conflict is Self-Conflict)"

- Kapil Gupta
"While his fellow human beings suffer the unending torment of “getting in their own way,” he sails toward the horizons of his very own choosing. Why? Because he has learned the secret of making his mind retreat when he needs it to retreat. And come forward when he needs it for his own personal use."

- Kapil Gupta
"Nine: The Mind is the ultimate slave master of man. And this Jedi has been led by the hand, inch by inch, compartment by compartment, through the Mind’s inner machinery.

- Kapil Gupta
"Competition is for the common man. I will state firmly that if you have competition, then your idea is not sufficiently original. And if it is not sufficiently original, it is essentially a job. And is there anything in this world that is more beneath the possibilities of a human being than a “job?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"“My partner, Bob, likes to say be a learn-it-all not a know-itall.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The intellect is largely a place of ego. One is more captivated by the idea THAT he knows than WHAT he knows."

- Kapil Gupta
"The path to ultimate wisdom is less about accumulating “information” and more about mining for the truth that exists inside of you"

- Kapil Gupta
"Knowledge of fundamental wisdoms is not transferable. And if it is transferable, it is certainly not transferable through words. For the peculiarity about words is that they always tend to miss."

- Kapil Gupta
"The man who understands that he is more ignorant than wise . . .

The man who understands that he has more to learn than he has to teach . . .

Is not being humble. For all attempts at humility are essentially artifice."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man is not comfortable unless he invents struggles."

- Kapil Gupta
"All things happen Before they happen."

- Kapil Gupta
"The common man is afraid of “losing.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"He may achieve periods of success in this struggle. But the success will be limited. And the struggle, unlimited."

- Kapil Gupta
"The man who becomes a legend is the man who arrives at the perfect questions."

- Kapil Gupta
"No matter how closely you may be reading
these words, your mind is reading them closer."

- Kapil Gupta
"Then man tries to be clever."

- Kapil Gupta
"What a man does have, the mind creates fear and anxiety of losing."

- Kapil Gupta
"What a man does not have, the mind creates fear and anxiety of not receiving."

- Kapil Gupta
"He will have to be willing to see that whatever “others” may give him will soon wash away with the shifting sands."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why is it impossible for man to be content with who he is?

Because the things that man believes himself to be are lights and shadows."

- Kapil Gupta
"How can he love himself if he does not know what love truly is?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Why is he not content with who he is?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Who is the one that is truly immune to what others think?

The one who acts in silence.

And makes not a single reactive statement."

- Kapil Gupta
"A person says, “I will do exactly as I please, no matter what anyone says.”

This is a reaction against a fear of being controlled by the opinions of others."

- Kapil Gupta
"A person says, “I don’t care what they think of me.”

This is a reaction against an ego that cannot bear the fact that it is indeed affected by what others think of it"

- Kapil Gupta
"Seeing is more doing than any possible doing you can do"

- Kapil Gupta
"The ultimate action is understanding."

- Kapil Gupta
"The real doing is a non-doing"

- Kapil Gupta
"The vast majority of time that the word "love" is used it is actually describing attachment."

- Kapil Gupta
"If something is all a human has ever known, he has no choice but to somehow justify it."

"If the Thing that created Him allowed him to create the business, does the money that arose from this business belongnto Him? Or to the Thing that created Him?"

- Kapil Gupta
"He will be willing to see that this attachment forces his hand."

- Kapil Gupta
"Attachment is neither good nor bad."

- Kapil Gupta
"What is this relationship?

The relationship is one of attachment"

- Kapil Gupta
"That which one believes to be “His,” imprisons him.

That which one “owns and possesses,” will become his greatest demon.

It will visit him in his nightmares."

- Kapil Gupta
"Thought is a habit of the mind. Mind is a habit of the ego.

Ego is a habit of the self.

And the self does not, in truth, exist."

- Kapil Gupta
"“What is it that I must see, that upon having seen it, I will never have to chase again?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"If man acts, it is a chase.

If he does not act, he does so out of “principle.”

Both roads lead back to themselves."

"Truth Is The End Of All Chases"

- Kapil Gupta
"Even as he reads these words, he will begin to fear that he might soon be asked to do something that is not “good.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The man who learns to think gains benefits in the world.

The man who learns to stop thinking gains a glory beyond all worldly rewards."

- Kapil Gupta
"That which does not exist in the mind, does not exist at all.

The thought that does not arise, can bring no turmoil."

- Kapil Gupta
"The man who knows not who he is does not suffer.

The one who suffers is the one who believes himself to be this or that."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is that a man who has no identity is the most effective human being in the world."

- Kapil Gupta
"Those who become the top 50 or the top 30 in the world have suffered the interference of the mind for quite a long time."

- Kapil Gupta
"But an entirely new form of training is required to get from 50 or 30 to World Number 1.

From here on in it’s the gauntlet, my friends. The gauntlet of The Human Mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"The secret path to World Number 1 does not happen through the ice rink, or the ski slopes, or the Olympic swimming pool, or the fairways at Augusta National. 

It happens squarely and solely through the tempest of the
mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you fight this tempest, it will destroy you.

If you listen to it, it will control you.

So what is an athlete to do?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Not “psychology.” Not “behavioral modification.” Not “positive thinking.” Not “visualizing.” Not “hope.” Not “process.”

U-N-D-E-R-S-T-A-N-D-I-N-G."

- Kapil Gupta
"Once you truly understand something, something very interesting happens: 

You become Free Of It. 

You escape its grasp."

- Kapil Gupta
"Does a dog barking in the distance trouble you? Does it put you into consternation? Does it make you fret and analyze?

No.

Why not?

Because you firmly understand that it is a dog, and that a dog’s nature is to bark. And because you understand this, it doesn’t trouble you on any deep level."

- Kapil Gupta
"1) the mind is a Desiring Machine.

2) that because it desires something, it simultaneously fears that it won’t get it.

3) the fear of Not getting it far exceeds the desire For getting it."

- Kapil Gupta
"The human being becomes instantly world class the moment he is Not Thinking at all."

- Kapil Gupta
"With increasing fear of failure came increasing thoughts. 

With increasing thoughts came increasing “perceived
consequences.’

With increasing perceived consequences came increasing anxiety. 

And with increasing anxiety came a Loss Of Freedom."

- Kapil Gupta
"For Rafael to say that maybe there is something he needs to do, what it suggests is that he has Insight. And believe me, insight is perhaps the rarest trait of a professional athlete. Such people tend to be receptive. And they tend to have a better than average shot at becoming World Number 1"

- Kapil Gupta
"Most athletes are taught and believe that doing more of the same in greater numbers and with greater intensity will get them to the top."

- Kapil Gupta
"The secret path to world number 1 is not to quiet the
mind or fight the mind. 

You cannot quiet a storm. 

And if you fight with it, you will lose every time. 

And lose badly."

- Kapil Gupta
"The secret path to world number 1 is to train every day to reach the state of No-Mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"The first question is this: Why are you not already a Buddha?"

- Kapil Gupta
"What is it that stands in your way of becoming a Buddha?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The first question is this: Why are you not already a Buddha?

Now, that is too general a question. So we must refine it.

What is it that stands in your way of becoming a Buddha?

This is a much more precise question. 

Do you see how it focuses your attention?"

- Kapil Gupta
"What is the one thing that stands between you and Instant Buddhahood?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The one thing that stands between you and Instant Buddhahood is The Mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"You are not the flesh and blood entity you believe yourself to be. 

You are actually a consciousness. 

But because you don’t realize this in your heart, you live as a condensed form of matter known as a flesh and blood human being."

"First time is attachment."

- Gohans
"Badness destroys.

Goodness does also."

- Kapil Gupta
"You see, dogs were meant to run and bark. And when you see a dog run and bark, you think nothing of it because you understand that this is the natural behavior of a dog."

- Kapil Gupta
"Imagine that you tied one end of the leash to your dog, and the other end of the leash around your neck. Yours would instantly become a tumultuous life, would it not?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The mind is such a subtle and clever entity that it is incredibly difficult to entertain the idea that it is separate from you."

- Kapil Gupta
"If it is the mind that prevents you from becoming a living, breathing Buddha, what should you do about it?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The mind cannot be calmed. Or tamed. Or changed.

It can only be Transcended."

- Kapil Gupta
"Love is overrated"

- Gohans
"When there is no mind, there is no ego. When there is no ego, there is no manufactured self. And it is then that you begin to live AS ever-present consciousness. 

It is then that You become a Buddha."

- Kapil Gupta
"These are questions I get from my clients all the time. 

If I don’t have a mind, won’t I lose my intelligence? 
Won’t I go insane? 
Won’t I become an emotionless stone?"

- Kapil Gupta
"You are far more intelligent Without the mind, than you ever will be With the mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man is a creature who has a thought, the thought produces an emotion, the emotion produces a reaction, and the reaction produces another thought, which produces another emotion, and another action, then another thought."

- Kapil Gupta
"Mind has made a schizophrenic."

- Kapil Gupta
"All the wars in the world are not caused by people. 

They are caused by Minds! 

Mind makes a man ruthless. 

For it functions through ego. 

And ego knows no limits and no compassion."

- Kapil Gupta
"You achieve the state in which the Seer becomes the Seen.

You see everything in High Definition, because the mind no longer stands as a veil between you and that which you choose to look at."

"The mind that was once your master, now becomes your slave. 

Only now are you able to use it to move mountains and part oceans."

"What are the signs that will tell you whether your belief was correct or incorrect?"

- Kapil Gupta
"What milestone or marker will mark the end of this belief experiment?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The truth, my friend, is Not that life is avoiding you. 

The truth is that it has been searching for you for decades."

- Kapil Gupta
"Freedom is not something that you work toward. It is something you cannot live without."

- Kapil Gupta
"Freedom is not something that you dream of. It is something that you live within."

- Kapil Gupta
"Freedom is not something that will one day come. If it does not come today, I promise you it will never ever come."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why should your life be any less free than the seagull who floats over the Atlantic?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Whatever you see, you don’t see in Full. Because as you’re trying to see, it’s talking."

- Kapil Gupta
"This voice inside your head.

It doesn’t necessarily speak to You. It just speaks.

Even as you’re reading these words, it’s speaking. After every third word, you’re interrupted."

- Kapil Gupta
"The tape recorder in your head is always left on. The battery never dies.

Those rare glimpses of Freedom and Bliss and Peace that you’ve felt in your life were the result of the tape recorder accidentally turning off."

- Kapil Gupta
It is like the cartoon of the man who has destroyed his entire house after numerous failed attempts at swatting a fly.
"Why do those who achieve it, achieve it?

And why do those who do not, fail to do so?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Motivations are never actually created. They are always latent in a particular human being."

- Kapil Gupta
"Thought-Freedom is not freedom of thought. 

It is the freedom to think only when you want to think."

- Kapil Gupta
"Thought-Freedom is to have Silence as your default state.

And thinking as a voluntary and utilitarian act."

- Kapil Gupta
"There are great ideas coming at you every minute. But you only hear them once in a blue moon. And this is because they are drowned out by the mental chatter. The noise. The constant stream of involuntary thought. The tape-recorder."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you attained Thought-Freedom, the voice of the person you are speaking to would not only be heard, it would be Felt. And in a short time, you would begin to hear the words he or she was Going to speak, before they even spoke them. Yes, you would be able to read their minds."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you attained Thought-Freedom, then you would become what you see. There would be a union between You and It."

- Kapil Gupta
"“take a moment to think before you react.”

My dear friend, if you have not achieved Thought Freedom, while you are “thinking” about your reaction, you are just sitting in the car which is wildly driving around the block. The thought is still not yours. It is not under your control. And, while you may produce a slightly less emotional outburst today, it is bound to be released tomorrow.

Because the car has not been parked still and quiet in the garage."

- Kapil Gupta
“All of man’s ills arise from his inability to be still.”

- Kapil Gupta
“The inability to sit still is the result of the greatest disease of mankind: Involuntary Thought.”

- Kapil Gupta
"Is this a Panacea?

It is in fact the only bona fide Panacea in existence."

- Kapil Gupta
"And then you will come to a point where you look around and find there are no thoughts. No matter where you look, there are no thoughts to be found. You can create them by thinking. But they are completely under your command."

- Kapil Gupta
"A man whose life is saturated in stress has no need to worry about stress eventually killing him.

For he’s already dead."

- Kapil Gupta
"He is a man who has wholeheartedly succumbed to the belief that if all of the things in his life can be fixed and arranged into a certain semblance of symmetry, Then he will be able to truly live"

- Kapil Gupta
"Because this thing we call life is a drop of quicksilver. You are free to arrange it into any shape you wish. But if you wish for it to maintain that shape you had better be prepared to sit on your knees holding it in that position forever"

- Kapil Gupta
"The modern executive’s life is so full of stress that he often doesn’t even recogize it as stress. He recognizes it as Life Itself."

- Kapil Gupta
"He decides to attend a week-long seminar on “stress management.”

Then he is doomed."

- Kapil Gupta
"Similarly, if you try to “manage” stress, it will spawn additional forms of stress."

- Kapil Gupta
"You will become stressed about not having overcome your stress."

- Kapil Gupta
"What I don’t understand is why the rarest thing in the world is a man who is willing to walk to the ends of the earth in order to discover The Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"Do you want to “manage” your stress?

Or do you want to be Free Of It?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Is it “wrong” to tell a middle school student to solve the problem of quantum gravity?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Is it “wrong” to tell a waitress who is earning minimum wage, to invest half a million dollars in a startup?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Unless you are willing to change your breathing pattern for life, it will only be a temporary fix. The stress will return with a vengeance."

- Kapil Gupta
"THE MIND IS TEN TIMES MORE FEARFUL OF NOT GETTING WHAT IT WANTS, THAN IT IS DESIROUS OF GETTING WHAT IT WANTS"

- Kapil Gupta
"you can settle this mind. And cure your stress in 90 seconds.

Shall I give you the secret?

Very well, my fellow man.

Go to your mind and say this:

“My dear mind, I understand that you’re agitated. If I were you, I would be agitated as well, given the uncertain and trying circumstances we face. You can keep your stress. I wouldn’t dream of taking it away from you. But if you could please limit it to 10% of what it is now..."

- Kapil Gupta
"YOUR PROBLEMS HAVE NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH THE OTHER PERSON."

- Kapil Gupta
"The way you feel about him (or her) needs only to be acknowledged and Never to be addressed or fixed or worked upon."

 Kapil Gupta
"Please drop all thoughts of trying to be “extra kind” or “more compromising” or “bending over backwards” as a means of saving or mending the relationship. 

Because nature has a way of Punishing insincerity. 

And when this kindness and compromise and bending over backwards is not returned, you will be twice as furious as before."

- Kapil Gupta
"Forget all ideas about trying to “make things better.” Forget about trying to mend the relationship."

- Kapil Gupta
"The relationship that needs to be addressed is Not the one between you and him. It is the one between you and your mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why does the ancticipation of your meeting with him cause you to stir inside?"

- Kapil Gupta
"My dear friend, your internal strife does not come from your anticipation of meeting with Him.

Your strife comes from your anticipation of meeting the part of yourself that you may not be able to control."

- Kapil Gupta
"You see, if you knew with Complete Certainty that no matter how disagreeable the meeting became, your Internal emotions would remain checked, and that your mind would not run wild, you would not feel any anticipation at all."

- Kapil Gupta
"The house that you are living in belongs to someone else.

The clothes that you are wearing were borrowed from someone else.

Your spouse is someone you are meeting for the first time.

Your children are being introduced to you for the first time.

The job that you are going to is not yours. You are filling in for someone.

The car which you drive to this job is not yours."

- Kapil Gupta
"You have no name. You have no history. You have no biography.

If someone calls you by your name, feel as if this name is foreign to you. You can go ahead and respond to the person."

- Kapil Gupta
"During the next 24 hours you have ZERO ambitions.

You have no desires.

If something needs to be done, you do it.

If someone calls you, you respond.

If someone asks you a question, you answer it.

BUT . . . as you answer their questions, stick to the facts.

DO NOT infuse it with your own personality or opinion.

Because you have no personality. And you have no opinion."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you ask it quickly, I will know that you are asking reflexively. It is not a True Question. It is a comment in the form of a question. Placing a question mark at the end of a comment does not make it a question."

- Kapil Gupta
"For no True Question begins with the word “how.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"“How” is rendered wholly inadequate in the matter of the human heart.

“How” is useless in the transformation of human beings."

- Kapil Gupta
"“How” is inoperative in the Real and Significant Matters of human existence."

- Kapil Gupta
"If all someone wants to do is “Manage” something, then they deserve to see one who only knows about managing it."

- Kapil Gupta
"So do I know the “How?” Yes, I could certainly create a HOW for you. But if you understood the way in which the human mind processes things, you would beg me Not to give you this “How.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"For if I give you the How, I can be absolutely certain that you will never do it. 

And even if by some chance you did it, it would lead nowhere. 

Because the reason that you would be doing it is because I told you to do it."

- Kapil Gupta
"When a man becomes a great success, he gradually becomes imprisoned by it. 

He continues to gain monetary and egoistic pleasures from his success. But he does not gain Peace from it. Rather, it torments him. It makes him anxious."

- Kapil Gupta
"The greatly successful man is believed to be “busy.” He is believed to be an “important man with many responsibilities.”

The truth is, his life is just as empty as anyone else’s. He procrastinates. He tries to find meaning. Just like anyone else."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Mind Spares No One! Especially The Accomplished Man."

- Kapil Gupta
"What is the cause of this emptiness? This stress? This
anxiety? Stated plainly, The Cause Is This Idea Of “Accomplishment.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Hear this: Explore and achieve until your heart is content. But consider None Of It an “achievement.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"A man can handle the 180-pound frame of his body. But he cannot handle the 3 oz label attached to it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man can handle a thousand grand successes. But the Idea of him becoming a “success” crushes him."

- Kapil Gupta
"He can have a thousand accomplishments. But looking back at them as “accomplishments” is simply an unbearable burden."

- Kapil Gupta
"Doing Things Sincerely is infinitely possible. Looking back at them in admiration and labeling them as “successes and failures” is the road to ruin."

- Kapil Gupta
"My friend, if you achieve the world and do not bother placing your name upon the achievement, you will be both Successful and Free."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you achieve the world and stamp your name across the achievement and imbibe it as Yours, you will be Successful and Imprisoned Forever."

- Kapil Gupta
"Understand that I am Not speaking of “humility.” All socalled humility in modern society is false. It is simply being “humble” in order to deathly avoid the label of “arrogant.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"I don’t believe in humility as a Principle."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you look upon your achievements as Yours and you firmly stamp them with your Name, you will live a life of Imprisonment."

- Kapil Gupta
"if arrogance is not an option, the idea of “humility” never takes birth. 

For the very genesis of the idea of “humility” is, in fact, the original idea of arrogance. If the latter is not an option, the former becomes the default.

And if something is the default, what is the need to Name It?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Freedom follows a man who subscribes to No Images.

Peace follows the man who has No allegiance to Form."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Power of Zeuss follows the man who invests the whole of his heart and his life energies into otherworldly pursuits without even the thought of calling them an “achievement.”

And, ironically, this becomes the Grandest “Achievement” in his life."

- Kapil Gupta
"IT IS NOT THAT HE LIVES IN FREEDOM AND OCCASIONALLY EXPERIENCES ANXIETY. IT IS ACTUALLY THAT HE IS ANXIOUS AND MOMENTARILY EXPERIENCES AN EPISODE OF FREEDOM."

- Kapil Gupta
"The things that are closest to us are the things that are most difficult to see."

- Kapil Gupta
"The rush to get to work on time is your Anxiety.

The rush to get the kids ready for school is your Anxiety.

The obsession of getting the kids to bed at night so that they may get to school on time the following morning is your Anxiety.

The compulsion to do a good job at work is your Anxiety.

The need to progress and succeed and accomplish is your Anxiety.

The thinking about yesterday’s lunch as you eat today’s dinner is your Anxiety."

- Kapil Gupta
"The searching for your keys, the dirty dishes in the sink, the
tires that need to be replaced, the amount that you need to tip
the waiter, the parking spot you hope for, the waiting for the
light to turn green, the choosing of the funds for the 401K, the
speed of your modem, the inbox that allows a spam message,
the light stain on the shirt, the tardiness of the landscaper, the
dip in the stock market, the thought of being promoted..."

- Kapil Gupta
"The question is not “What makes you anxious?”

The question is “What doesn’t?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The question is not “When are you anxious.”

The question is “When are you not?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The majority of people who read this discourse will say, “But the things that you mentioned are a normal part of life.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Must you change the car tires? Yes.

Must you brush your teeth? Yes.

Must you get the kids to bed and to school? Yes.

Must you search for your car keys? Yes.

Must you address low internet speeds? Yes.

When you are doing these things, do you feel calm? Relaxed? Joyful? Blissful? Equanimous?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The Experience of your life, the flavor that you taste, the coolness or warmth on your skin is NOT the result of What You Do. 

The Experience of your life is a function of How You Feel When You Do It."

- Kapil Gupta
"Understand this clearly: Anxiety will absolutely make a man die sooner."

- Kapil Gupta
"The most arduous life, lived in poverty may not affect the man who holds it at arm’s length.

The most luxurious life filled with accomplishments and riches may completely bind a man who holds it close."

- Kapil Gupta
"For man does not do what he SHOULD. He does what he FEELS."

- Kapil Gupta
"I will state quite frankly that greater than 99% of the people on this Earth will die having never escaped their anxieties.

This has always been so.

They will die never having known Peace.

They will die never having known Freedom.

They will die Never Having Lived."

- Kapil Gupta
"THE MAN WHO IS CONVINCED THAT HIS BODY AND HIS MIND ARE HIM IS DOOMED TO A LIFE OF ANXIETY."

- Kapil Gupta
"What else can you be but anxious?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The world equates intelligence with information. If someone knows a lot about something, he is known as “intelligent.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"“Very well. If you are so intelligent, then why is this not an everyday occurrence? If it’s under your conscious control, why would you not use this intelligence every day? Why wouldn’t you create 100 brilliant world-changing ideas every afternoon?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"What is a lamp without electricity?

What is a sailboat without wind?

What is a plant without sunlight?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Human beings, by themselves, are very limited creatures. And perhaps something within them recognizes this limitation, thus spawning the need to create an Ego of being intelligent in order to make up for the feeling of
emptiness."

- Kapil Gupta
"Understand this: That which comes From you will be limited. That which flows Through you will be divine."

- Kapil Gupta
"Ultimate Intelligence is not a creation, but an availability.

It is not a form of action. But a form of surrender."

- Kapil Gupta
"Instead of filling yourself with effort, you will make yourself empty so that the Truth may enter.

Instead of creating clever answers, you will begin forming exquisite questions."

"If the wind does not come, it sits.

If the wind caresses it, it flows.

It desires neither.

Yet surrenders to both."

"When it hangs limp, it has no anticipation of when the breeze might return. For it is content to lay still forever. 

And when it flows, it thinks not of when the breeze might give it rest. For it finds rest within the flow. 

This ribbon tells a story to the person who is willing to listen. 

And the story that it tells is the story of our lives."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a common man is asked to look at this ribbon, he will consider it insignificant. 

And the reason that he will consider it insignificant is because he feels that his life is MORE significant than the ribbon."

- Kapil Gupta
"If I were to tell him that his life has no greater significance than this fluttering ribbon he might feel insulted."

- Kapil Gupta
"All of our dreams. Our aspirations. Our expectations. And desires. Amount to nothing more than a ribbon fluttering in the winds of a mountain wilderness."

- Kapil Gupta
"We look at our life as if it were a mountain.

But it is only a ribbon."

And once it is gone, it is gone forever."

"It is a grand irony of life that that which appears permanent is fleeting. And that which appears fleeting is the closest thing to permanence.

The ribbon knows this.

Perhaps this is why it dances."

"“Sports psychologists” say that nervousness is completely “normal.” 

And that if you Weren’t nervous “there would be something wrong with you.”"

- Kapil Gupta
THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN THE TRUTH. THEY ARE INTERESTED IN JUSTIFYING THE STATUS QUO.
"Rare is the Man who seeks Freedom. 

For he is content with a “scientific” explanation as to why Freedom is not possible."

- Kapil Gupta
"“I don’t care about the best of the best. And if they get nervous, then they don’t inspire me at all. Tell me where nervousness comes from. Tell me Why I’m nervous. Where does this nervousness Fundamentally come from, dear adviser. Tell me, damn it! This is why I hired you! Tell me Now!!!!”"

- Kapil Gupta
“I don’t know! I can just try to help you deal with it. No one has ever asked me where it comes from. So why should I spend my time learning about that? There’s demand for the treatment. There’s no demand for the Why!”

- Kapil Gupta
"After the times I felt nervous, I said to myself, “The fact that you are nervous means that there is something obviously wrong. Let’s figure out where this nervousness comes from.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"NERVOUSNESS ARISES BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO GAIN FROM THE TRANSACTION. IF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN, YOU WILL NOT FEEL NERVOUS"

- Kapil Gupta
"The Question is not “how do I stop being nervous?” or “how do I deal with the nervousness?”

The Great Question is this: “How can I be so sincere, so authentic, that I have everything to give, and nothing to gain?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"My friend, wherever there is Hope or Gain, there is Mind.

And wherever there is Offering, there is No-Mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"I find myself speaking less and less. It has now occurred on several occasions that I sit before my laptop screen and feel an intense emptiness to it all and I shut the screen, toss it onto my desk, pull the blanket up to my neck, close my eyes and feel the IMMEDIACY of my existence"

- Kapil Gupta
"I’ve never been a “group” sort of individual. I’ve never gone to any dinner or event with a “group” of five, ten, or twenty unless something in the situation Forced me to do so."

- Kapil Gupta
"I’ve always been a ONE-ON-ONE person. ALWAYS. To be even more honest, I’ve always been a ONE-on-ZERO person. I’ve spent most of my life communicating with myself. The societal and social issues have never interested me."

- Kapil Gupta
"When I send out a SIDDHA INSIGHT, or “update” the membership about my latest discourse, I’ve begun to question the point of doing so."

- Kapil Gupta
"Listen, my friend, it’s true that I’ve written a book and I have informed the audience that I’ve written a book and I’ve told them where they can get the book. But quite frankly, I’m really NOT trying to “sell you” anything."

- Kapil Gupta
"Am I trying to “teach you” something?

Am I “hoping” that you will read it and send me an email telling me how much you like it?

Am I trying to “help” you? (whatever that means).

What’s the point?"

- Kapil Gupta
"IF my Siddha Insights or my discourses enrich your life in any way, then you will come because you Want to come. And you will read because you Want to read. And you will implement if you Want to implement."

- Kapil Gupta
"It makes us believe that who we are now we will always be.

It makes us believe that what we have now we will always have.

It tells us that death comes to OTHERS, but it will not come to ME.

It tells us that our accomplishments will always be ours.

It tells us that our lives will always be JUST SO. And that if we HOPE, they will be even better."

- Kapil Gupta
"Whatever you have accomplished will one day be lost Without A Trace."

- Kapil Gupta
"But, oh dear friend, many “know” in their head that such a day is coming. But WHO AMONG US feels it in their heart?"

- Kapil Gupta
"You might have looked at your children differently. Instead of spending your life “teaching” them your knowledge, perhaps you should have LEARNED from their JOY."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is often the case that human beings fail to see things not because they are too far, but because they are hidden right under their nose."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is a chase in the morning. A chase in the evening. A chase at work. A chase with the children. A chase for achievement."

- Kapil Gupta
"Enlightenment is not an Achievement. For it does not come to the ambitious."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man’s greatest fear is his fear of HIMSELF."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you lead him by the hand to a world of peace, he will hesitate. For what will he do without a world of turmoil?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Peace is a dangerous world for him.

And bliss can only be handled in small doses."

- Kapil Gupta
"YOUR MIND WILL NEVER SPARE YOU."

- Kapil Gupta
"When they arrive there, they laugh. They laugh, not necessarily because of the joy they feel, but because of the complete absurdity that was the foundation of their previous existence."

- Kapil Gupta
"You wear many faces, my dear. Some you show to the world. Some you keep hidden in the closet. And some you cannot bear to reveal even to yourself."

- Kapil Gupta
"WHEN YOU DISAPPEAR, YOUR PROBLEMS WILL AS WELL."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you continue to live your life as one of your FACES, you will NEVER achieve Peace.

Why?

Because it is this very face that robs you of it.

Equanimity. Enlightenment. Peace. Nirvana. Moksha. Samadhi. Mushin."

- Kapil Gupta
"They are available to the one who is willing to exchange his identity of being SOMETHING in return for becoming NOTHING.

And understand this: When a man becomes nothing, he instantly becomes EVERYTHING!"

- Kapil Gupta
"It is not that you have become accustomed to satisfaction or dissatisfaction with your life. 

Rather, you have become accustomed to living in between satisfaction and dissatisfaction."

- Kapil Gupta
"The only person who sets off on a journey is the one who is fed up, who has had enough, who cannot take the status quo any longer. Unless you reach this point, your journey will not have the necessary fuel to begin."

- Kapil Gupta
"How acceptable to you is your volatility of temperament, boredom, excitement, productivity, and joy?

How acceptable to you is your enslavement to your emotions?

How acceptable to you is the fact that your life is NOT putty in your hands?

How acceptable to you is it that you cannot kill your mind when it misbehaves?

How acceptable to you is it that you cannot make your life and your accomplishments EXACTLY the way you want them, simply by an act of will?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Because what else could be more important?

What is the alternative?
How else should one spend the life he has been given?

Living in misery and mediocrity?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The very fact that you have put in the energy to write me this heartfelt letter reveals the fact that there lies within you the seed of transformation."

- Kapil Gupta
"Ethics and morality live in church sermons. They do not live in the hearts of human beings."

- Kapil Gupta
"School has nothing to do with education."

- Kapil Gupta
"Fundamental truths are learned on the pavement, not the blackboard."

- Kapil Gupta
"Hard work is simply an exercise in beating one’s head against the wall."

- Kapil Gupta
"The person who tells you HOW is your enemy.

The person who asks HOW has no interest in learning. 

Both are complicit."

- Kapil Gupta
"Once a human being knows the WHAT, if he is serious he will figure out the how."

- Kapil Gupta
"Lists of HOW-TO’s are not followed by anyone. 

Not even the person writing them."

- Kapil Gupta
"Human beings do not respond to prescriptions.

They respond to that which they are driven by."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you attempt to raise your children, they will become broken adults."

- Kapil Gupta
"Parents do not raise children, nature does."

- Kapil Gupta
"Society is an illusion. It does not exist."

- Kapil Gupta
"People worry about ‘society’ because it is a much easier alternative than examining themselves."

- Kapil Gupta
"Should your child learn from you how to be miserable?

Or should you learn from him how to be joyful?"

- Kapil Gupta
"You refuse to ask the question because you are afraid of the answer."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you meditate to gain something, the only thing you will gain is frustration."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because you do not KNOW, you settle for BELIEF."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you would be willing to admit that you do not know, the possibility of knowing arises."

- Kapil Gupta
"If instead you cling to a belief, knowing becomes impossible."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you admit that you do not know, you may go on a search to find out.

If you believe, you will not go on any search. 

You will remain in your world of fantasies and illusions, hoping and believing."

- Kapil Gupta
"You have not loved anyone your entire life."

- Kapil Gupta
"Love is not an act.

It is a quality."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you have not become it, you cannot give it. 

For you cannot give what you do not have."

- Kapil Gupta
"The true reason that you help the poor (and you will never admit it in a thousand years) is because it gives you a feeling of superiority."

- Kapil Gupta
"The poor do not need your ‘help.’"

- Kapil Gupta
"Even if you do it anonymously, you know very well you are not being anonymous from the person who has the greatest need to know."

"You may keep it from the entire world. But you cannot keep it from yourself."

"If you say something for long enough, mass belief is not far behind."

- Kapil Gupta
"The world of coaching is filled with the idea of more."

- Kapil Gupta
"Progress is simply a pat on the back. 

Progress is a silly little massage of encouragement."

- Kapil Gupta
"What does it matter if you do something a little bit better than yesterday?

What does it matter if the graph that you have so lovingly created is incrementally more steep than it was last month? 

What does it matter if you holed more putts this week than last week? 

What does it matter that you’ve got a bit more power from that wrist shot?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Oh, but Dr. Gupta you don’t understand that it takes time for the muscle memory and the neuronal myelination and the establishment of new motor patterns . . ."

- Kapil Gupta
"Do you know what the most powerful muscle memory in the world is?

The muscle memory of inertia!"

- Kapil Gupta
"In continually emphasizing the Process, everyone has become addicted to the Progress."

- Kapil Gupta
"I am extraordinarily impatient with my clients. Because there is no time to waste."

- Kapil Gupta
"The mind is addicted to time. And it will amble within it forever. It will turn your dreams into eventual maybe’s."

- Kapil Gupta
"The mind is addicted to time."

- Kapil Gupta
"How many years will you wither away in the process?"

- Kapil Gupta
"When will you understand that the most critical element of success in any endeavor is URGENCY!"

- Kapil Gupta
"Which is attempting to be united is not unifiable."

- Kapil Gupta
"You ask, “What is the purpose of my life?”

Did you ask this question when you were a child?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Adults have traded their joy for intelligence."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you were joyful in your life, you would NEVER ask about life’s purpose."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a tree could speak, do you think it would ask it’s life’s purpose?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The person who is afraid of life is the one who stands back and asks about its purpose."

- Kapil Gupta
"Even if I were to help you discover the purpose of your life, your mind would soon want a new purpose."

- Kapil Gupta
"The question to ask is NOT “what is my life’s purpose?”

The question to ask is “what is the nature of my relationship with my life, which causes such a question to arise?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"What is your relationship with life?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Betrayal is the price of trust."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is not the betrayal you must move through. 

It is this addiction to being hurt that you must move through. 

It provides you with a certain solace to sit with your pain."

- Kapil Gupta
"You may continue with the cycle of trust and occasional betrayal in exchange for the luxury of pain."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perhaps in seeing beyond the game, you will be on your way to transcending the bigger games that you play, without even realizing that you are playing them."

- Kapil Gupta
"Have you noticed that when you are feeling happy, it is very difficult to get angry? When you are happy, that which would normally make you angry has little effect on you."

- Kapil Gupta
"Nothing that arises within the mind lasts. Because the mind is ephemeral. 

Happiness is simply the sister of misery. 

So once the state of happiness passes, you become once again SUBJECT to anger and irritability."

- Kapil Gupta
"The question is NOT: How Do You Deal With Anger?

The question is: In What State Of Being Do You Become SUSCEPTIBLE To Anger?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The question is NOT: How Do You Deal With Anger? For once it arises, it is already too late. The best you can do at this stage is damage control."

- Kapil Gupta
"In What State Of Being Do You Become SUSCEPTIBLE To Anger?"

- Kapil Gupta
"My friends, WE ARE ALL DYING. When today ends, you will be ONE DAY CLOSER TO YOUR DEATH.

We have no time for EVENTUALLY.

And I have no time for SILENT SUBSCRIBERS."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you are alive you will have troubles. This will never end. You will have them until your dying day."

- Kapil Gupta
"You don’t have any real desire to end your soap operas. You can’t live without them. You enjoy them. They add meaning to your life. They are like bits of your jewelry."

- Kapil Gupta
"You RELISH your problems. And this is why they will never go away."

- Kapil Gupta
"You enjoy the times of sorrow. You feel a sense of comfort when you cry. Wallowing in guilt is a delicacy. Playing the victim is a luxury."

- Kapil Gupta
"All your problems, your disappointments, your guilt, your worry, your miseries, your pain, your sorrow, your apprehensions, and anxieties could disappear in an instant. 

But where would that leave you? 
Who would you be without them? 
What would you do with your time?"

- Kapil Gupta
"They exist because you invite them."

- Kapil Gupta
"And since this wasn’t enough to muddy the circumstances of your life, you have now added a new level of complexity by stating that you want to get rid of them. 

This will keep you busy forever. 
And this is what you are seeking to do."

- Kapil Gupta
"Human beings have a habit of creating problems for themselves in order to add meaning to their lives"

- Kapil Gupta
"The mind that asks me for help in ridding it of problems is the very same one that created the problems to begin with."

- Kapil Gupta
"You are the creator of your own destiny. So why not have fun with it?"

- Kapil Gupta
"How about you live without problems on Mondays, and invite them all back on Tuesday through Sunday?

In this way, you will give your self at least one day a week in which you can live freely, after which you can promptly return to your soap operas."

- Kapil Gupta
"Aren’t you tired of looking at yourself?

Of the sound of your voice?

Of knowing what you are going to say before you say it?

Of thinking the same things?

Of living with the same opinions?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Aren’t you tired of this person called YOU?"

- Kapil Gupta
"You try to preserve yourself in front of others. But you run away from yourself in private."

- Kapil Gupta
"Wouldn’t you like to see through new eyes. Eyes that see what is actually in front of them. Eyes that seek reality instead of confirmation."

- Kapil Gupta
"Wouldn’t you like to look into the mirror and see only the mirror?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Hasn’t this YOU become a burden as of yet? For how long will you carry it around?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The YOU that you have been told to look for is the same YOU that has prevented you from seeing."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because you will finally be free of the YOU that brought about all the concerns.

May you never be Yourself ever again."

- Kapil Gupta
"What Will I Do Without My Children?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Dr. Gupta, my children have grown and moved out of the house. It should not be a surprise to me. I knew this day would come. And I have dreaded it for fifteen years. Dr. Gupta, my house is quiet. And the noise I used to complain about is the noise I crave for. I’ve been so silly. So petty. And now that they’re gone I just don’t know what to do. My life has revolved around them. And now there is this big hole in my life. What should I do?"

- Kapil Gupta
"You are not asking the question that you really want to ask. You don’t really want to know WHAT YOU SHOULD DO."

- Kapil Gupta
"What you really want to ask me is, 

Is it okay to live in their memory?
 Is it okay to pretend as if they were still here?
 Do I really need to move on?
I know that I’m supposed to accept this as a part of life, but I don’t want to accept it, so does that make me crazy?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Allow yourself to BE. Be any WAY you wish you to be. If it’s crazy, so be it. If it is called depression, so be it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Even though they are gone, be with them. Be with their old clothes. Their toothbrush. Their baby teeth. Their fingerprints on the wall.

You need not _move on_. You need not be _reasonable_.
Such things take care of themselves.

Simply allow yourself the freedom to feel. To any degree. In any way. For as long as you like. 

If and when this ends, a different sort of question will arise. 

And when it does, please send it to me."

- Kapil Gupta
"The most cataclysmic mistake of your entire life is BELIEVING THAT YOU HAVE TIME."

- Kapil Gupta
"Do you know that your days are numbered?

You will likely reply with a reflexive and meaningless “yes.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"If it tell you that you might die TOMORROW, you will acknowledge this in a Trivial Pursuit-sort of fashion. You will acknowledge it with that matter-of-fact KNOWING. 

You will probably even be thinking of something else while answering the question."

- Kapil Gupta
"Your mind says that for you it will be different. That you are special. 

Your mind will ask you, “Do you really think you are going to die tomorrow?” It will tell you that you have plenty of time."

- Kapil Gupta
"Is there any shortage of death around you? Are people not dying everywhere? Every hour? Every single day?"

- Kapil Gupta
"I know you won’t believe me.

 Your mind will dismiss my words.

It will bring your attention back to planning the next thirty years of your life"

- Kapil Gupta
"You look at your life and you see an endless horizon. You see an endless amount of time. 

And this one fact more than any other robs you of the opportunity for bliss."

- Kapil Gupta
"If only we were told the time and the day that we were going to die.

Perhaps then we would be convinced that we have no time."

- Kapil Gupta
"How many decades has it been since you looked at that person in the mirror?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The mask that you carry around is not only to show to others. It is also to show to yourself."

- Kapil Gupta
"You may look into the mirror every day of your life. But you haven’t seen yourself in years."

- Kapil Gupta
"The mirror is very clever, is it not? It only shows you what you want to see. It is complicit in your self-betrayal."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you decide to look, why not look THROUGH the reflection instead of AT it? Look into the eyes for as far as you can see"

- Kapil Gupta
"Which is the real you? 

The one who looks into the mirror?

Or the one who looks from it?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Human beings were meant to have children.

But they were not meant to be parents."

- Kapil Gupta
"Understanding and patience and all the virtues that are ‘supposed to be’ exemplified by parents really have nothing to do with parenting."

- Kapil Gupta
"The child lives in the moment. He cares not for practicality or sensibility or responsibility or appropriateness. Such things are not a part of his life. 

The parent lives precisely in the world of practicality and sensibility. To him, the moment is as far away as the setting sun."

- Kapil Gupta
"When one is not blissful, for whatever reason, he lives in a constant state of irritation. The slightest sound, word, or behavior is earth shattering to him. As a result, he is prone to emotional outbursts."

- Kapil Gupta
"Dr. Gupta, I’ve been working at a job that does not provide me any satisfaction. I basically do it to pay the bills. I feel that there is so much more that I can offer to myself and to the world. I know exactly the path I wish to take, in a perfect world. Should I quit my job to follow my dream? Or should I find a way to somehow live with it? Thank you."

- Kapil Gupta
"Where you are now is the direct result of what you prioritize. As of this moment your priority is not to follow the path that you instinctively feel that you should embark upon"

- Kapil Gupta
"I am simply telling you that the reason that you have not done so as of yet is because this has not become your overwhelming priority. It might become your priority tomorrow. Or next week. Or never"

- Kapil Gupta
"The time that you are spending to ask me what you should do is the mind’s clever ploy of avoiding the matter altogether.

As long as you are talking about it, you are avoiding it."

- Kapil Gupta
"You may be miserable at your job, but you’re not quite miserable enough."

- Kapil Gupta
"You might want to follow your dreams, but you’re not sold on them yet"

- Kapil Gupta
"Lukewarm is a purgatory, Gordon. Uncomfortable to stay. But not uncomfortable enough to leave."

- Kapil Gupta
"When your misery becomes unbearable to the point that you simply cannot find it in yourself to work there one more day, your path will change.

INSTANTLY"

- Kapil Gupta
"And instead of asking me what you should do. You will be telling me what you did."

- Kapil Gupta
"Parents are in the habit of giving too much to their children.

And most of what they give is not only detrimental to the child’s growth, but it interferes in his development as an individual."

- Kapil Gupta
"The child is barely born and the parent stands in wait with a suitcase full of advice."

- Kapil Gupta
"The greatest thing you can do for your child is to not interfere."

- Kapil Gupta
"The mind is the greatest burden known to man."

- Kapil Gupta
"The teacher teaches the how, not only because he feels it is the only way or the best way. But because he simply loves to do so. He gains something from it. Emotionally and financially."

- Kapil Gupta
"The student asks the how, because he seeks a quick resolution to his problem. And though it may only work temporarily, he becomes accustomed to this chase."

- Kapil Gupta
"The great teachers are not teachers at all. They are seekers. 

They are not so much interested in their student’s development of technique, as they are in the development of his understanding."

- Kapil Gupta
"Asking for the how does not make one great. It makes one dependent."

- Kapil Gupta
"Seek understanding. Not instruction."

- Kapil Gupta
"For the ultimate technique is devoid of conscious action."

- Kapil Gupta
"The ultimate understanding is devoid of thought."

- Kapil Gupta
"One who has an ego is not the one who is proud or boastful.

It is the one who simply feels that he exists as an independent being."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one says, “I am great,” his ego does not begin with the word “great”. 

It begins with the word “I.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"It will incessantly proclaim “I am!”

And as long is IT IS, it will be subject to countless blows"

- Kapil Gupta
"If you look at the lives of ambitious individuals who are on the road towards “success,” you will inevitably see tremendous conflict. Conflict within themselves. Conflict in relationships. Conflict all around."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you find what you love . . .

If you find the very thing that produces joy inside you simply by the act of doing it . . .

If you find that thing in which you can totally immerse yourself and which consumes your daily thoughts . . .

Success is inevitable.

It will come of its own accord. Without chasing it. "

- Kapil Gupta
"The problem is that most people chase success for success’ sake. It is not that they wish to be successful at something in particular. 

They simply wish to be A SUCCESS. "

- Kapil Gupta
"No competition. No hope. No striving. No scheming. No judgments. No comparisons. 

Simply an all out immersion in your chosen discipline"

- Kapil Gupta
"Everyone human being claims he wishes to be happy

If happiness was what you truly craved, you would have had it a long time ago.

What you really want is the events of your life to happen in a way that you believe will give rise to happiness."

- Kapil Gupta
"What you really want is the events of your life to happen in a way that you believe will give rise to happiness."

- Kapil Gupta
"If happiness was what you truly craved, you would have had it a long time ago."

- Kapil Gupta
"Let me tell you this: You may die today. Or you may die tomorrow. But whenever you die, you will die an unhappy person."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you truly wanted happiness you would be willing to let go of EVERYTHING."

- Kapil Gupta
"Your hopes and your dreams and your relationships would be come playful little things, rather than life-altering events.

And in this way, you could move freely. Without a care in the world."

- Kapil Gupta
"To Do Or Not To Do Is NOT The Question"

- Kapil Gupta
"Everything outside of us is happening without us. And everything inside of us is happening without us."

- Kapil Gupta
"So why are we under such great compulsion TO DO? What
is it that we are constantly struggling TO DO? Where is it that we are constantly rushing TO GO?

The answer is Not to NOT DO.

There is no answer"

- Kapil Gupta
"Doesn’t UNDOING perhaps make more sense?

And doesn’t the futility of our DOING make even more sense?"

- Kapil Gupta
"WHAT ARE WE DOING?

WHY ARE WE DOING?

Isn’t everything already done?

What will our DOING do?

Will it change anything?

Will it create for us a new world?"

- Kapil Gupta
"In the end, our doing is just a habit of doing. It is not a means to any end."

- Kapil Gupta
"If there is an act of doing, perhaps it is not to do anything at all."

- Kapil Gupta
"What does it mean to be EDUCATED?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Society’s idea of education is that a human being has had SCHOOLING."

- Kapil Gupta
"He has done this on the promise that doing so will allow him to earn a salary and support himself and his family."

- Kapil Gupta
"Get a degree and the world will give you a job."

- Kapil Gupta
"Did the 12 or 16-plus years of education that you had do anything to enhance your actual life?"

- Kapil Gupta
"If you spent 12 or 16 years doing something, it must be very important for your life, should it not?

The payoff should be huge, shouldn’t it?

Has the payoff been huge?

Was it worth it?"

- Kapil Gupta
"You will love whatever you pour your heart into. Passion follows commitment."

- James Clear
"No one can stop a person who's determined to learn."

-
"It is cruel that we’ve expected 22 year olds to pick a career for the rest of their life"

- Kapil Gupta
“God gave you the power to ignore. Use it.”

-
"Why do we believe that filling our heads with useless information is something that we should spend the most coveted years of our life pursuing?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Why do we believe that learning about dead people from the past and learning about fancy numbers and charts and signs and symbols has anything to do with living a joyous, productive, or successful life?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Do we even remember any of those things that we learned?"

- Kapil Gupta
"We will spend at least 16 years of our life pursuing something on a daily basis, which we will almost completely forget, and never use.

- Kapil Gupta
"School is a nightclub in the daytime hours. It is a convenience for working parents."

- Kapil Gupta
"Education has created more dead people than all the cemetaries in the world combined."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perhaps the uneducated ones in the world are more attune to life than those who are educated."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perhaps it comes down to a choice between life vs knowledge."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perhaps the best approach of education would be to pursue a knowledge of life."

- Kapil Gupta
"We could learn to live, rather than talk about it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perhaps the most ignorant man who has escaped the machine of education, maintains his primordial and virgin state of being, and thus is the most educated of all"

- Kapil Gupta
"The problem with love lies in understanding what it truly is. We only know about the things that we have associated with the word love. And we have, for so long, taken these things to be love. 

Perhaps the best place to begin is to understand what love is not."

- Kapil Gupta
"Love is not possession.

Love is not control.

Love is not expectation.

Love is not hope.

Love is not subordination.

Love is not infatuation.

Love is not agreement.

Love is not negotiation.

Love is not cooperation.

Love is not compromise."

- Kapil Gupta
"Do any of us truly know love? 

Have any of us ever known love?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Love is like the concept of God: we do not dare to imagine ourselves without it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why should love take effort? 

If it does take effort, it is because we try to conform it to the contours of our beliefs, and mold it into the shape of our expectations."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perhaps love is not something that we do, but something we are.

Perhaps love is not directed toward anyone or anything. 

Perhaps we are simply a wellspring of it. 

Perhaps we carry with us the potential and the capability of it, but do not allow it to surface."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perhaps love is not directed toward anyone or anything."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perhaps love is not something that we do, but something we are."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perhaps love arises when we escape from the regimented and cocooned existence that we call life, and allow ourselves simply to be."

- Kapil Gupta
"Perhaps love is, only when we are not."

- Kapil Gupta
"Where is the place where the mind can have such a direct influence on someone else? 

A place where human beings have complete access to the sensibilities, the thoughts, and the fears of another. 

A place in which control of another human being’s life is a most seductive proposition? 

A place in which emotions, desires, expectations, and guilt are intricately woven into the very foundation."

- Kapil Gupta
"The family is a place in which mind collides with mind. 

Each searching for its own place. Each longing for its own freedom."

- Kapil Gupta
"But what is not understood is that that which seeks freedom is the very thing produces the enslavement."

- Kapil Gupta
"What makes the concept of family so cumbersome is that every member of the family is lost in a search for something."

- Kapil Gupta
"What makes the family so dangerous is that none of the members knows what precisely it is he is searching for"

- Kapil Gupta
"Was This The Work You Were Meant For?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Why do you do what you do?"

- Kapil Gupta
"When you were a child, sitting alone on the edge of your bed, is this the dream that you dreamed? 

Is this the craft that you imagined for yourself?"

- Kapil Gupta
"What is your work? What is it really? I am not asking what you do. I’m asking what is your work?"

- Kapil Gupta
"If it is simply work, can you make it something else?

If it is simply work, can you see it for what it is?"

- Kapil Gupta
"What is the one thing you have always avoided? 

What is that thing that you were always forced to stop doing?"

- Kapil Gupta
"If you had only one day left to live, is the place you go now, the place you would go then?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The body does not respond to the music. It personifies it."

- Kapil Gupta
Dance is an organic state of flow. In this state the body is instruction-less and technique-less. 

It is like water, flowing from pure instinct and thoughtlessness.
"When a dancer has reached a particular level of skill, he must seek to abandon technique and allow the body to move under the weight of its own momentum."

- Kapil Gupta
"Performance is a contrivance, a lie."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you see the audience as watchers, you will
become self-conscious. 

If you see them as critics, you will become tense. 

If you do not see them at all, your greatness will shine."

- Kapil Gupta
" If you see the audience as watchers, you will become self-conscious."

- Kapil Gupta
"Your greatest performance will be the one in which you do not try to perform."

- Kapil Gupta
"The best is not what you do, it is what emerges from you."

- Kapil Gupta
"Dance is about the dance, not the dancer."

- Kapil Gupta
"Abandon all methodologies. Drop your adherence to technique. Discard your positive imagery. And allow yourself to be."

- Kapil Gupta
"Your eyes will have seen it, but it will not register."

- Kapil Gupta
"No human can give anything to another human."

- Kapil Gupta
"What a human receives is never received precisely in the way that it is given. 

It is never received in its raw form."

- Kapil Gupta
"The only human who is able to truly give is the one who does not need."

- Kapil Gupta
"True giving can be achieved in these particular circumstances precisely because one can be free of need in these scenarios."

- Kapil Gupta
"Giving emotionally to a relative or family member without hope of return is a virtually impossibility"

- Kapil Gupta
"Humans are caught in a devastating conundrum."

-Kapil Gupta
"“Good” and “right” are imprisonments of man."

- Kapil Gupta
"For who can condemn a man for wanting to be “good” and to do the “right” thing?"

- Kapil Gupta
"“Good” and “right” and “moral” and “immoral” and “kind” and “unkind” and “empathetic” and “cold” are words that only have meaning within the false domain in which they were created."

- Kapil Gupta
"Try as he might, no human being can live up to a “word” or an “ideal.”

For “words” and “ideals” are moving targets."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you ask a thief why he steals, whatever answer he gives you will have been repackaged as “justified” and “moral” in his mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you do not accept this, I will provide you with a name which may instantly settle the matter for you:

Adolf Hitler."

- Kapil Gupta
"Each person attempting to fill their needs through the auspices of a “relationship.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"if two humans have come together in order to fulfill their needs, then the relationship isn’t about the “two people” at all.

It is only about themselves."

- Kapil Gupta
"For if they were both “needless” they would likely not have started the relationship to begin with."

- Kapil Gupta
"Human relationships consist of two independent individuals who are bound by a thread of need."

- Kapil Gupta
"Neither human in this relationship has anything to offer to the other, no matter how much they would like to."

- Kapil Gupta
"Two broken pieces cannot be mended."

- Kapil Gupta
"Henry Miller once said that it is a crime to bring children into this world."

- Kapil Gupta
"For every parent ruins their children. No matter how “welladjusted” they may turn out to be."

- Kapil Gupta
"Every parent ruins their children."

- Kapil Gupta
"They are quick to say that “biological organisms are programmed to have progeny.”

Factual though this may be, my response is this, “Biology is only interested in itself. It does not give a pittance about YOU.”"

"“Biology is only interested in itself. It does not give a pittance about YOU.”"

- Kapil Gupta
“Nature Does Not Give A Damn About You.”

- Kapil Gupta
"Nature is nature’s business."

- Kapil Gupta
"Nature is concerned only with itself."

- Kapil Gupta
"Nature is concerned only with itself.

But what to do with this problem called “Your life?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Man may be horrified to learn that nature is “selfish.” But here we have yet another example of a “moving target” packaged as an ideal."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is only when a human being becomes whole within himself, that he is good to himself or to any other human being"

- Kapil Gupta
"It is only when he genuinely arrives at a place of needing nothing or no one that he is able to receive without pleasure, or to give without hope."

- Kapil Gupta
"What a human seeks above all else in this life is Freedom.

And this freedom can only be provided by one thing, and one thing only:

The Truth."

- Kapil Gupta
"The game that is being played, is never the real game."

- Kapil Gupta
"The game does not create awards.

The awards create the game."

- Kapil Gupta
"Like rivers that flow toward the Sea, the minds of men flow toward pleasure."

- Kapil Gupta
"The one who figures out the game within the game is the one who reorients his mind away from pleasure."

- Kapil Gupta
"Stand witness to the patterns that are invisible to the untrained mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"Before one is able to learn the true game, he must first learn to See."

- Kapil Gupta
"Before one is able to learn the true game, he must first learn to See.

For if he does not, the only things that will be visible to him are light and dark shadows. And he will enter the world of the blind."

- Kapil Gupta
"In order to See, one must discover what it is that is propelling him in a particular direction."

- Kapil Gupta
"In order to See, one must discover what it is that is propelling him in a particular direction.

One must discover the true nature of his motivation.

For it is this very motivation that creates the game that he plays."

- Kapil Gupta
"The Truth is that no man truly sees The Game."

- Kapil Gupta
"For men have, for eons, become conditioned to the game of Personal Gain."

- Kapil Gupta
"The trap of “spirituality,” which hails personal gain as a tenet not to be broken."

- Kapil Gupta
"The game of personal gain does not break any tenets. Rather, it prevents one from Seeing what needs to be seen."

- Kapil Gupta
"The man of Truth views the game as it is being played, and he asks himself, “Is what these people saying based upon Truth? Or is it based upon conditioning? And if I am feeling a pull toward this game, what precisely is it that is pulling me?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"I don’t possess a very high regard for a “how to” method of learning. For this rarely leads to mastery."

- Kapil Gupta
"My Approach To Coaching

The cornerstone of my approach is this: To teach in a way that utilizes the intelligence of the human machine as an asset, rather than a hurdle. And to impart information in a manner that allows the player to create motions that are based upon HIS UNDERSTANDING of the matter, rather than a mimicry of the matter."

- Kapil Gupta
"Because you learned through rote and mimicry, rather than through understanding, you will forever be dependent upon me to “fix” you."

- Kapil Gupta
"If I say things and explain things in whatever manner I must in order to help you UNDERSTAND, your setup and your motions will be created BY YOU, based upon your understanding."

- Kapil Gupta
"If nothing caused your heart to skip a beat, there would be no difficulties in your life."

- Kapil Gupta
"I won’t ask you if You’re ready.

That will put you on the spot and you will feel compelled to respond in a way which sounds correct but, in reality, is false."

Disenchantment."

Yes. For those in denial."

There is nothing"

"Everything is disappearing."

"I have discovered that we human beings have an enormous capacity for pain. Enormous pain is a price we are willing to pay satisfy the cravings of the Mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that if this “me” is opened and dissected, it falls apart. 

There is nothing there.
There is nothing there. 
There is nothing there. 
There is . . . nothing."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that there is great ego in selfimprovement."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that resolving conflicts is yet another way to chase pleasure."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that I do not want to “feel good.” I do not want everything to “be okay.” For I have realized that this is the calm before the storm. It is purely and simply, a setup."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that I do not want misery. But I will not chase pleasure in order to remove it."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that when I want nothing, life becomes docile."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that my children do not belong to me. And if I attempt to possess them, life will rage toward me, through them."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that prescriptions are the downfall of man."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that everything we as humans do is nothing more than an attempt to “feel good.”

We are pleasure chasers.
There is nothing wrong or right with this. 
I do not look at things in terms of right and wrong.

I look at things in terms of Effective and Ineffective."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that life is unforgiving. 

We get only one shot. 

We get only one shot at our children being 7, 12, and 14. 

We get only one shot at everything."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that we rise or we fall in our own eyes.

That no matter how big or small we may look to another, 

it is how our self views us that has the greatest impact upon us."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that I no longer wish to see myself as I speak."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that this world holds nothing for me.

It is smoke and mirrors. It is a creation of the Mind.

As is the one who seeks something from it."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that my life is a steady retreat into the self. 

In doing so, I begin to live as that which I am, and shed that which I am not. 

Leaving is more effective than arriving."

- Kapil Gupta
"I have discovered that I am most blissful when I write. I write what I am. I wish I could live within my writings. 

For me, it is the most peaceful and blissful corner of the world. 

To be lost in communion with my innermost realizations. 

And immersed in the tragedies of my innermost follies."

- Kapil Gupta
"My younger son just came and gave me a hug and a kiss.

For no reason at all. I lost myself in his embrace.

I have tears in my eyes.

Namaste."

- Kapil Gupta
"A human’s every waking moment is spent chasing pleasure.

Some actions are subtle.

Some are not

But each and every action is motivated by pleasure."

- Kapil Gupta
"Even the things that you do not find pleasurable, there is some pleasure that you gain from them in some way.

Otherwise you simply would not do them."

- Kapil Gupta
"What is wrong with chasing pleasure?

There is nothing wrong with anything."

- Kapil Gupta
"A human that constantly chases pleasure must be one that is always dissatisfied

The same way that an animal that always chases food must be one that is always hungry."

- Kapil Gupta
"Chasing pleasure brings pleasure.

But it does not bring satisfaction."

- Kapil Gupta
"For if it brought satisfaction, one would chase it once, receive it once, and be done with it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Today you will chase 60-140 pleasures.

You will gain satisfaction from Zero."

- Kapil Gupta
"The mind has no interest in satisfaction."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you continue to chase pleasure, you will feel more and more empty.

If you stop chasing pleasure, you will think of pleasure.

If you try to stop thinking of pleasure, you will not be able to sustain it."

- Kapil Gupta
"A human being becomes less human each day that he lives."

- Kapil Gupta
"While he sleeps he has no problems."

- Kapil Gupta
"Each morning as he arrives, he looks into the water that has filled the hole. And he sees his own reflection. 

He does his duty and returns home, exhausted and somewhat satisfied. For putting in an honorable day of “hard work.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"It is like a child who digs a deep hole on the beach, just at the edge of the shore. When he leaves for the day, the hole is free of water.

He goes home for the night, and when he returns the following morning he notices that the ocean has filled the hole with water. It takes him from sun up to sun down to empty the hole with an 8 oz cup.

Once he leaves, the hole is again free of water. When he returns the following morning, it is filled again."

- Kapil Gupta
"Understand that we are nothing but slaves. 

We do nothing that is independent of the mind.

The mind likes. We do not.

The mind hates. We do not."

- Kapil Gupta
"Seriousness is quiet."

- Kapil Gupta
"Is the sky falling?

Dear friend, the sky fell a long time ago.

It fell while we were asleep.

And we have been asleep for eons."

- Kapil Gupta
"Once he sees the devastation . . .

Once he sees it from his heart . . .

The quality of the questions change."

- Kapil Gupta
"Freedom is freedom from anxiety.

Freedom from all conflicts.

Freedom from involuntary thought.

Freedom from compulsion.

Freedom from every sort of need.

Freedom from emotional turmoil.

Freedom from a roller coaster existence."

- Kapil Gupta
"He had nowhere to go.

Because somewhere inside of him he was fully invested with the understanding . . . that he had already arrived."

- Kapil Gupta
"The “Where’s” that once attracted me, attract me no more."

- Kapil Gupta
"How silly . . . to try to improve a burning ship."

- Kapil Gupta
"There is a reason that trees have no names.

Call them by the name that you have given them, and they do not respond"

- Kapil Gupta
"Even death does not compare to the hell one experiences once he creates an identity"

- Kapil Gupta
"Wisdom lies in retreating from all things.

Not an intentional retreat.

But an Inevitable Retreat."

- Kapil Gupta
"Nowhere . . . is the only place a man can be Free.

And No One . . . is the only thing he can be Free as."

- Kapil Gupta
"Thought is something that man holds dear. He takes pride in his ability to think."

- Kapil Gupta
"Thinking prevents one from seeing who he is"

- Kapil Gupta
"If there is a problem one wishes to solve, thought is the most ineffective way in which to solve it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Occasionally and accidentally one is liberated from this thinking, the clouds part, and he gains clarity. And then he Sees without having to “think.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The world-changing ideas that humans have do not often come in the form of traditional thought. They come in the form of Spontaneous Vision."

- Kapil Gupta
"“Don’t think” is itself a thought."

- Kapil Gupta
"Thought creates emotional turmoil.

To use thought to end emotional turmoil is to perpetuate the emotional turmoil."

- Kapil Gupta
"Thought is false intelligence."

- Kapil Gupta
"Genius has little use for thought."

- Kapil Gupta
"Once one is trained to overcome involuntary thought, he then acquires the superhuman capability of thinking only when he wishes."

- Kapil Gupta
"“Why should you not have it Today?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"If I examine my feelings for him from the perspective of a father, things become clouded."

- Kapil Gupta
"I do not know what love is.

But I do know what attachment is."

- Kapil Gupta
"A psychology professor of mine used to say, “Pain is the price for having loved.”

I disagree with him.

The Truth is . . . “Pain is the price for having been attached.”"

 - Kapil Gupta
"Meditation will never conquer attachment."

- Kapil Gupta
"Meditation doesn’t conquer anything."

- Kapil Gupta
"For when I lose myself, I do not record the event in memory."

- Kapil Gupta
"If one lives in the self, he lives in the world.

If he lives in the world, he becomes the world."

"The tree is leaning in the distance. Perfectly still. Its branches nod in the wind.

It has arrived."

- Kapil Gupta
"It is only the most ostensibly intelligent species in existence that is imperfect."

- Kapil Gupta
"A dog may chase its tail.

But man chases a tail that he does not have."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man has wandered into the mind, and called it home."

- Kapil Gupta
"No man need fear death.

For how can a man fear something that he already is?"

- Kapil Gupta
"There is no point in trying to convince the dead of their dead-ness."

- Kapil Gupta
"If I did not see another human being for as long as I lived . . .

If I did not speak another word until the end of time . . .

I would hardly notice.

How horrid is a life of chasing."

- Kapil Gupta
"Man is prideful of his intellect. It is a bell he cannot stop ringing. And the fact that he does it endlessly is evidence for the fact that it does not satisfy."

- Kapil Gupta
"For that which truly works need only be done once.

And that which satisfies need only be tasted once."

- Kapil Gupta
"In the Arrival, one grows silent. For he is captured by Awe.

Speaking becomes laborious."

- Kapil Gupta
"If an attempt is made to see it as terrible, or view it as silly, this is the most deplorable thing of all. 

There is Nothing."

- Kapil Gupta
"But how can a man understand that there is nothing while he is beholden to the idea of Something?"

- Kapil Gupta
"M: If I tell you, you will consider it. As you consider it, you will either believe or not believe. If you believe it, you will not have understood. If you do not believe it, you will not have understood."

- Kapil Gupta
"S: Then why does the Truth come to you and not to me?

M: Because I am more serious than you."

- Kapil Gupta
"The “exception” is not something to be swept under the rug. The Exception is the possibility."

- Kapil Gupta
"They even follow the ones who have reached the top.

This is why they do not achieve greatness."

- Kapil Gupta
"Why do some practice for the whole of their lives, yet never come close to their pinnacle?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Why do some athletes shoot straight to the top, while others practice and practice and practice, but end up having to work two jobs while their talent is left to waste?"

- Kapil Gupta
"No one can blame these people for being lazy, or for not having practiced."

- Kapil Gupta
"All things in this society are a cult."

- Kapil Gupta
"They subscribe to a religion. The religion of “hard work.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"The more accumulated hours of “hard work” one puts in, the more (false) sense of satisfaction he gains."

- Kapil Gupta
"The problem with “experience” as a form of practice, is that one becomes solidified in his beliefs."

- Kapil Gupta
"True Greatness requires the sort of person who would like at his own mother from three different angles in order to verify that it was Truly her"

- Kapil Gupta
"True Greatness requires such a maniacal and uncompromising heartfelt craving for what the Holy Grail Truly Is, that he has zero time for any society, man, or world who is not hell-bent on such a journey."

- Kapil Gupta
"Is there such a thing as a self?

Does it, in reality, exist?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Faith and belief lead to endless problems."

- Kapil Gupta
"The fingers type these words.

The eyes see them on the page.

The heart pumps blood.

The lungs inhale and exhale.

There is no self behind all of this.

There is no one there."

- Kapil Gupta
"Where there is a Me, there must be a You.

Where there are two, there will be differences."

- Kapil Gupta
"Where there are differences, there will be conflict"

- Kapil Gupta
"For whatever he does to this self, he will be doing it to something that does not fundamentally exist.

Thus, he will swim in an ocean of problems.

Until the day he dies.

And he will die without ever having acquired the Freedom of knowing . . .

That he never really existed at all."

- Kapil Gupta
"Thought Is An Unawakened State"

- Kapil Gupta
"When a man hears himself speak, the voice that he hears is a false voice.

It was created by thought."

- Kapil Gupta
In the world of thought, there are only problems. Even the “good times” are laced with problems.
"As you have read these words today, thought has perhaps interpreted them as “that’s very interesting,” or “one day I will have to look into this.”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Man spends his life attending to things that thought created.

He tends to a life that does not exist."

- Kapil Gupta
For if I were to say that everything went wrong because of “X,” then the human will begin to try to modify and “fix” this “X.”

But this is the main reason why he lost his way.

For when the human was fully human, there was no “X” to “fix.” The thought of ‘fixing’ and ‘doing’ and ‘practicing’ never arose.
"But as time went on, natural things became replaced by manufactured things."

 - Kapil Gupta
"The natural action was really a non-action."

- Kapil Gupta
"No tree tries to improve itself.

No cloud tries to better itself."

- Kapil Gupta
"Humans have become so polluted by conditioning they are virtually immune to The Truth"

If he is told Not to do any of these things, he will think to himself, “Well, I must do Something! I can’t not do anything. How will I get better? How will I improve?”"

- Kapil Gupta
"Doing something creates problems."

- Kapil Gupta
"Doing nothing also creates problems."

- Kapil Gupta
"He is a robot who is in constant search of external inputs."

- Kapil Gupta
"He closes his eyes and pretends to be blind, so that he may give himself the false security of a seeing-eye dog"

- Kapil Gupta
"He would spend 24 hours of every day learning “best practices” and the “latest techniques” for how to pump his hear and which hand to hold it in."

- Kapil Gupta
"The beauty of nature lies in its unabashed naturalness"

- Kapil Gupta
"A masterpiece created by the hand of man can only be created if the hand is set free."

"Disappointment arises."

The road to recovery begins with understanding."

- Kapil Gupta
"'If a game is played for gain, it cannot be truly played."

- Kapil Gupta
"A siddha does notvcome to win. He does not come to lose. He comes to play."

- Kapil Gupta
"The siddha plays to lose himself. The non-siddha plays to enhance himself."

- Kapil Gupta
"An athlete does not want to win, he craves it."

- Kapil Gupta
"Is it really the win, or the feeling associated with the win?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Talking of reality is of no use, because that is not where we live. 

We live inside a world created entirely by our mind."

- Kapil Gupta
"A person who is not free allows the result to define him."

- Kapil Gupta
"You are playing a game of self preservation, a game of crisis management, in the guise of basketball."

- Kapil Gupta
"How do you begin to practice such a game? By coming to the heart-felt realization that this is the game that you actually play"

- Kapil Gupta
"For information to get into a player’s heart, for the words of a coach to enter a player’s bones, the player must first be receptive. Not auditorally, but emotionally."

- Kapil Gupta
"Even if he participates in such a ranking system, he does not take it to heart, for he realizes it is pure illusion."

- Kapil Gupta
"For it is precisely the possibility of glory or doom before the shot that makes the shot exciting."

- Kapil Gupta
"The possibility of failure is something that you love as part of the game. What would the game be without it?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Winning is a relative index. Potential is unconditional."

- Kapil Gupta
"Rather than ask, ‘what do I need to do to win’, where is the athlete who asks ‘what can I as a human being achieve on this earth?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The trajectory of your life will be determined by the questions that you ask rather than by the answers you receive. "

- Kapil Gupta
"The reason that players fail to one-putt is that they are afraid to three-putt."

"True success is more innocent than innovative."

Those that are taught will be forgotten"

"He, thus, fails to emulate the swing, not necessarily for lack of talent, but because the swing that he is emulating does not exist."

- Kapil Gupta
"The golf swing is a reaction to the setup."

- Kapil Gupta
"How does a game have the power to produce a physiological response almost identical to that which occurs in a true life and death situation?"

- Kapil Gupta
"When a game is perceived as life and death, the game is no longer a game."

- Kapil Gupta
"If a win produces elation, you may wish to examine what it is you have won. If a loss produces despair, you may wish to examine what you believe you have lost."

- Kapil Gupta
"Is it about the trophy? Or is it something else?

Is it about the ranking? Or is it something deeper?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Freezing in what is perceived to be the critical moment in a game is a response to overwhelming fear."

- Kapil Gupta
"For such a fear to arise, something enormously valuable must be at stake."

- Kapil Gupta
"If you feel such a fear, I assure you that the game you are afraid to lose is not the one you think you are playing."

- Kapil Gupta
"When the rituals work, he is satisfied. When they don’t, he experiences the same emotions which are now directed toward the failure of the rituals"

- Kapil Gupta
"If you never explore the nature and source of your emotions, you will always be a slave to them. "

- Kapil Gupta
"n order to reach the ultimate, the mind must not be calmed, but transcended."

- Kapil Gupta
"If children were taught to walk the way golfers are taught to swing, they would be equally handicapped"

"Great teachers are an endangered species. Great students are practically extinct."

- Kapil Gupta
"The body does not respond to the music. It personifies it"

- Kapil Gupta
"Though the teacher may explain the concept, rarely does he transmit it."

Is it a prescribed set of behaviors?

It simply works."

"My only question is: Does it work?

And if so, how often? And with what percentage of athletes?"

- Kapil Gupta
"Dr. Gupta, I’ve read your discourses on teaching. And I have a question related to this. As a coach, I often have to teach and re-teach the same technique numerous times. My players are very intelligent. But why don’t they get it? Or, at least, get it sooner?"

- Kapil Gupta
"The problem with language is that it tells you what, but not how much.
