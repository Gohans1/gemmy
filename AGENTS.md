## Available Skills

<!-- SKILLS_TABLE_START -->
<usage>
When users ask you to perform tasks, check if any of the available skills below can help complete the task more effectively. Skills provide specialized capabilities and domain knowledge.

How to use skills:
- Invoke: Bash("openskills read <skill-name>")
- The skill content will load with detailed instructions on how to complete the task
- Base directory provided in output for resolving bundled resources (references/, scripts/, assets/)

Usage notes:
- Only use skills listed in <available_skills> below
- Do not invoke a skill that is already loaded in your context
- Each skill invocation is stateless
</usage>

<available_skills>

<skill>
<name>beads</name>
<description>Track complex, multi-session work with dependency graphs using beads issue tracker. Use when work spans multiple sessions, has complex dependencies, or requires persistent context across compaction cycles. For simple single-session linear tasks, TodoWrite remains appropriate.</description>

# Beads_System
## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**FIRST TIME?** Just run `bd init` - it auto-imports issues from git:

```bash
bd init --prefix bd
```

**OSS Contributor?** Use the contributor wizard for fork workflows:

```bash
bd init --contributor  # Interactive setup for separate planning repo
```

**Team Member?** Use the team wizard for branch workflows:

```bash
bd init --team  # Interactive setup for team collaboration
```

**Check for ready work:**

```bash
bv --robot-insights
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**

```bash
bd create "Issue title" --description="Detailed context" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" --description="What this issue is about" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**

```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**

```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bv --robot-insights`, `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" --description="Details about what was found" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:

- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents

AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:

- PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files

**Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**

**Recommended approach:**

- Create a `history/` directory in the project root
- Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`
- Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files
- Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning

**Example .gitignore entry (optional):**

```
# AI planning documents (ephemeral)
history/
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Clean repository root
- ✅ Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation
- ✅ Easy to exclude from version control if desired
- ✅ Preserves planning history for archaeological research
- ✅ Reduces noise when browsing the project

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bv --robot-insights`,`bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ✅ Store AI planning docs in `history/` directory
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems
- ❌ Do NOT clutter repo root with planning documents

# Beads_viewer_system
### Using bv as an AI sidecar

bv is a fast terminal UI for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). It renders lists/details and precomputes dependency metrics (PageRank, critical path, cycles, etc.) so you instantly see blockers and execution order. For agents, it’s a graph sidecar: instead of parsing JSONL or risking hallucinated traversal, call the robot flags to get deterministic, dependency-aware outputs.

*IMPORTANT: As an agent, you must ONLY use bv with the robot flags, otherwise you'll get stuck in the interactive TUI that's intended for human usage only!*

- bv --robot-help — shows all AI-facing commands.
- bv --robot-insights — JSON graph metrics (PageRank, betweenness, HITS, critical path, cycles) with top-N summaries for quick triage.
- bv --robot-plan — JSON execution plan: parallel tracks, items per track, and unblocks lists showing what each item frees up.
- bv --robot-priority — JSON priority recommendations with reasoning and confidence.
- bv --robot-recipes — list recipes (default, actionable, blocked, etc.); apply via bv --recipe <name> to pre-filter/sort before other flags.
- bv --robot-diff --diff-since <commit|date> — JSON diff of issue changes, new/closed items, and cycles introduced/resolved.

Use these commands instead of hand-rolling graph logic; bv already computes the hard parts so agents can act safely and quickly.
